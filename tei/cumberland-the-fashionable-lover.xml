     THE FASHIONABLE LOVER; A COMEDY: As it is acted at the
THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.
    </p>
    <p>
     LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, at GARRICK's HEAD, in
Catharine-Street, Strand. MDCCLXXII.

     ADVERTISEMENT.
    </head>
    <p>
     I COMMIT this Comedy to the press with all possible
gratitude to the Public for the reception it has met: I cannot flatter myself
that the same applause will follow it to the closet; for as it owed much
to an excellent representation, I have neither on this, nor any preceding
occasion, considered myself otherwise than as a sharer only with the
Managers and Performers, who have distinguished themselves in the
exhibition of my trifling productions. But it is not on the score of
spectacle only that I am obliged to Mr. Garrick; I am both in the instance
of this Comedy, and in that of the West Indian, materially indebted to his
judgment, and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his
suggestion and advice: the correction of a real critic is as different from
that of a pretender, as the operation of a surgeon from the stab of an
assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
     <pb n="vi"/>
     The Comedy, now submitted to the reader, is
design'd as an attempt upon his heart, and as such proceeds with little
deviation from mine; if it should be thought therefore, that I have meant
well, the charge of having executed indifferently I shall patiently submit
to: I have on this occasion, (as on the two preceding ones) wholly rested
my performance upon such poor abilities, as I am master of; I am not
conscious of having drawn any particular assistance, either in
respect of character or design, from the productions of others; altho' I
am far from presuming to say or think, that I have ever exhibited any
character purely original: The level manners of a polish'd country, like
this, do not supply much matter for the comic muse, which delights in
variety and extravagance; whereever therefore I have made any attempts at
novelty, I have found myself obliged either to dive into the lower class of
men, or betake myself to the out-skirts of the empire; the center is too
equal and refined for such purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether the reception of this Comedy may be such, as shall
encourage me to future efforts, is of small consequence to the public;
     <pb n="vii"/>
     but if it should chance to obtain some little credit
with the candid part of mankind, and it's author for once escape without
those personal and unworthy aspersions, which writers, who hide their
own names, fling on them who publish their's, my success it may be hoped
will draw forth others to the undertaking with far superior requisites; and
that there are numbers under this description, whose sensibility keeps
'em silent, I am well perswaded when I consider how general it is for
men of the finest parts, to be subject to the finest feelings; and I
would submit whether this unhandsome practice of abuse, is not
calculated to create in the minds of men of genius, not only a disinclination
to engage in dramatic compositions, but a languid and unanimated manner of
executing them: It will drive men from a necessary confidence in their own
powers, and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrent's way, by
mooring under the lee of some great name, either French or Italian, and
sitting down contented with the humble, but less exposed, task of
translation. Should this take place, a cold elaborate stile will prevail in
our drama, clearly opposite to the national
     <pb n="viii"/>
     character,
and not at all at unison with the taste of our writers themselves.
Correctness will become the chief object in view, by which, though much may
be avoided, little will be obtained: nothing great can be accomplished on a
plain; turn to Shakespear, and you find the Alps not more irregular than his
genius; had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal
spirit which seems reserved for our time, the bold and daring sallies
of the sublimest Muse would probably have been suppressed, and
neither the great Actor who has brought his scenes to life, nor the elegant
Essayist

     who has defended them, would have made
such display of their own genius in the celebration and protection of
his.

     <l>
      I AM a devil, so please you—and must hoof
     </l>
     <l>
      Up to the poet yonder with this proof:
     </l>
     <l>
      I'd read it to you, but, in faith, 'tis odds
     </l>
     <l>
      For one poor Devil to face so many Gods.
     </l>
     <l>
      A ready imp I am, who kindly greets
     </l>
     <l>
      Young authors with their first exploits in sheets;
     </l>
     <l>
      While the Press groans, in place of dry-nurse stands,
     </l>
     <l>
      And takes the bantling from the midwife's hands.
     </l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
     <l>
      If any author of prolific brains,
     </l>
     <l>
      In this good company, feels labour-pains;
     </l>
     <l>
      If any gentle poet, big with rhime,
     </l>
     <l>
      Has run his reck'ning out and gone his time;
     </l>
     <l>
      If any critic, pregnant with ill-nature,
     </l>
     <l>
      Cries out to be deliver'd of his satire;
     </l>
     <l>
      Know such that at our Hospital of Muses
     </l>
     <l>
      He may lye in, in private, if he chuses;
     </l>
     <l>
      We've single lodgings there for secret sinners,
     </l>
     <l>
      With good encouragement for young beginners.
     </l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
     <l>
      Here's one now that is free enough in reason;
     </l>
     <l>
      This bard breeds regularly once a season;
     </l>
     <l>
      Three of a sort, of homely form and feature,
     </l>
     <l>
      The plain coarse progeny of humble nature;
     </l>
     <l>
      Home-bred and born; no strangers he displays,
     </l>
     <l>
      Nor tortures free-born limbs in stiff French stays:
     </l>
     <l>
      <pb n="x"/>
      Two you have rear'd; but between you and
me,
     </l>
     <l>
      This youngest is the fav'rite of the three.
     </l>
     <l>
      Nine tedious months he bore this babe about,
     </l>
     <l>
      Let it in charity live nine nights out;
     </l>
     <l>
      Stay but his month up; give some little law;
     </l>
     <l>
      'Tis cowardly to attack him in the straw.
     </l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
     <l>
      Dear Gentlemen Correctors, be more civil;
     </l>
     <l>
      Kind courteous Sirs, take counsel of the Devil;
     </l>
     <l>
      Stop your abuse, for while your readers see
     </l>
     <l>
      Such malice, they impute your works to me;
     </l>
     <l>
      Thus, while you gather no one sprig of fame,
     </l>
     <l>
      Your poor unhappy friend is put to shame:
     </l>
     <l>
      Faith, Sirs, you shou'd have some consideration,
     </l>
     <l>
      When ev'n the Devil pleads against Damnation.

      LADIES, your country's ornament and pride,

      Ye, whom the nuptial deity has tied

      For pity's sake some portion of your art

      How you would have me live with my good man?

     <l>
      If with the fatal thirst of desperate play
     </l>
     <l>
      I shou'd turn day to night and night to day;

     <l>
      Of each pert animal that meets my eyes,

     <l>
      Say are these objects worth my serious aim;
     </l>
     <l>
      Do they give happiness or health or fame?
     </l>
     <l>
      Are hecatombs of lovers hearts of force

     <l>
      To deprecate the demons of divorce?

     <l>
      Speak, my advisers, shall I gain the plan

     </l>
     <l>
      At their own weapons that proud sex defies
     </l>
     <l>
      And sets up a new female paradise?

     <l>
      Lights for the ladies! Hark, the bar-bells sound!

     <l>
      Show to the club-room—See the glass goes
round—

     <l>
      Hail, happy meeting of the good and fair,
     </l>
     <l>
      Soft relaxation from domestic care,
     </l>
     <l>
      Where virgin minds are early train'd to loo,
     </l>
     <l>
      And all Newmarket opens to the view.
     </l>

    <lg>
     <l>
      In these gay scenes shall I affect to move,
     </l>
     <l>
      Or pass my hours in dull domestic love?
     </l>
     <l>
      Shall I to rural solitudes descend
     </l>
     <l>
      With Tyrrel my protector, guardian, friend,
     </l>
     <l>
      Or to the rich Pantheon's round repair,
     </l>
     <l>
      And blaze the brightest heathen-goddess there?
     </l>
     <l>
      Where shall I six? Determine ye who know,
     </l>
     <l>
      Shall I renounce my husband, or Soho?
     </l>
     <l>
      With eyes half-open'd and an aking head
     </l>
     <l>
      And ev'n the artificial roses dead,

     <l>
      When to my toilette's morning task resign'd,

     <l>
      What visitations then may seize my mind!

       No, there may be a legal prostitute as well as a licentious
one; had you a world to give, after your base experiment, you cannot offer
any thing that I shall take. You may find others less exceptious; but in a
noble family, though stripp'd of fortune, there will still be pride.

'twas there that eighteen years ago I lost a wife, and left an infant
daughter. All-disposing Providence, who hast ordain'd me to this hour,
and thro' innumerable toils and dangers led me back to this affecting spot,
can it be wonder'd at, if I approach it with an anxious aching heart, uncertain
as I am if I have still a child or not? What shall I do? If my Augusta's
lost, 'twere better I should never enter those ill-omen'd doors; if she
survives, how shall I disclose myself, and tell her she has
still a father? Oh, that unknown and unperceiv'd, I cou'd but catch a sight
of her, gaze till I'd gratified my longing, and till this throbbing might
abate! I'll watch the door till somebody comes out, that I may speak to.
