    <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
    <p>SIGISMOND, the son of the Emperor Charles IV. was elected King of Hungary 1386, and Emperor of Germany 1410. His first wife, Mary, being dead, he espoused, about the year 1414, Barbara, the daughter of Hernan, Count of Cilley. Sigismond made the Counts of Cilley independent Princes of the Empire; and called them to the Diets, without the consent of the House of Austria, their supreme Lords, who, unwilling to emancipate the County from its dependance upon them, declared war against the Count in possession. By Barbara, Sigismond had only one child, a daughter, named Elizabeth. Sigismond died 1437.</p>
    <p>Albert V. Duke of Austria, who had married Elizabeth, Sigismond's daughter, succeeded him in the Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary. Albert died 1440, leaving two daughters; his Queen Elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death; the child proved a son, and was named Ladislaus.</p>
    <p>Upon the death of Albert II. as Emperor, and V. as Duke of Austria, his cousin, Frederick, great grandson of Albert II. Duke of Austria, was immediately elected Emperor.</p>
    <p><pb n="4" facs="17"/>The Hungarians, almost constantly engaged in war against the Turks, either for the defence of their own country, or of the neighbouring states, deemed an infant Prince and a Queen Regent unequal to the safe government of a kingdom which, by frequent wars, was kept in continual alarm. The crown of Hungary, by the constitution of the kingdom, being elective, (though sometimes possessed in hereditary succession) Uladislaus, the young King of Poland, was chosen King, by the advice of John Corvin Huniades, Earl of Bistrie, whom Uladislaus made Vaywode of Transylvania. Huniades was as celebrated for his virtues as for his valour. He was pious towards God, faithful to his country and his prince, and kind and benevolent to his friends; as a warrior he was politic, of invincible courage, and mostly fortunate: he was the first Christian commander who showed that the Turks might be overcome; and he obtained more victories against them than any one of the Christian Princes before him<note n="*" place="foot">Sir William Temple says that, "Huniades was one of the three Worthies who deserved a Crown without wearing one." The reward, merited by the virtues and great talents of the father, was paid to the son; for in 1458, the Hungarians, from their love to Huniades, and grateful remembrance of his long services, chose his son, Matthias Corvinus, for their King.</note>.</p>
    <p>Elizabeth, unable to prevent this choice, put her son, Ladislaus, under the protection of the Emperor Frederick III. Thus, of Albert's possessions, only Austria, and the kingdom of Bohemia, remained unalienated from his posthumous son, Ladislaus.</p>
    <p><pb n="5" facs="18"/>In the battle of Varna, 1444, fought between the Turks, commanded by their King, Amurath II. and the Hungarians, led by Huniades, Uladislaus the King of Hungary was slain; Huniades, by whose side he fought, having left him to go and rally the left wing of the Christian army.</p>
    <p>The Hungarians now elected Albert's son Ladislaus King; and they chose Huniades, their General, Governor of Hungary during his minority. The Emperor Frederick detaining the infant King in Germany, Huniades, as Governor of Hungary, declared war against him. After a long contest, which the Hungarians were obliged to intermit, on account of their wars against the Turks, the Emperor, not strong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incursions of the Hungarians, at last in 1452 delivered up their king; then eleven years of age. An assembly was appointed at Vienna, to which the nobles of Hungary and Bohemia were invited. At this assembly it was decreed that, during the minority of Ladislaus, Huniades should govern Hungary; that George Podiebrad should govern Bohemia; and that Ulrick, Count of Cilley, great uncle to the King, should govern Austria, and be guardian of his person.</p>
    <p>Count Cilley, envious of the glory of Huniades, excited some parties of Bohemians and Moravians to attack Upper Austria: but they proved unsuccessful when opposed by Huniades. Ambitious of the government of Hungary, Count Cilley accused Huniades, the Governor, to the King; but he justified
    <pb n="6" facs="19"/>
    himself from the accusation. Count Cilley's ambition increasing with the power which he derived from being the King's guardian; he attempted to make himself absolute master of Austria. To effect which, he secured the principal fortresses, by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his interest; gradually removing Elsinger, and the Austrian nobility, from all offices of importance. This conduct gave great umbrage to the people. Elsinger took advantage of their discontent; and, aided by Huniades, obliged Ulrick to retire to his own territory of Cilley. Thus, by the bravery and conduct of these two warriors, Austria was wrested from Count Cilley's usurpation.</p>
    <p>Mahomet II. the seventh King, and the first Emperor of the Turks, who took Constantinople May 29, 1453, which his great grandfather, Bajazet I. and his father Amurath II. had unsuccessfully besieged, marched 1456<note n="*" place="foot">New Universal History, vol. XXVI. p. 296, there is a mistake in the date of this Siege of Belgrade, which is there put down A.D. 1459; and in vol. XXXII. p. 149, the date is 1456, which last agrees with other Historians.</note> with an army of 150,000 men to besiege Belgrade, then thought the key to Hungary.</p>
    <p>As soon as the report of Mahomet's intention to besiege Belgrade, reached the young King Ladislaus, then fifteen years of age, he fled to the court of the Emperor Frederick; which much displeased his Hungarian subjects, as it had before cost them a long and tedious contest to get him out of the Emperor's power.</p>
    <p><pb n="7" facs="20"/>Besides his numerous army, of 150,000 men, Mahomet provided a fleet, of 200 ships and gallies, which he sent up the Danube from Viden to Belgrade; to the intent that no relief, or aid, should be brought into the city out of Hungary by the great rivers of the Danube and the Save; upon the confluence of which, the city of Belgrade stands. Not contented with thus closely blockading the city on all sides, Mahomet sent part of his fleet further up the Danube, and landing troops spoiled the country in many places on the banks of the river. On his first coming before Belgrade, he made a fierce assault, but was repulsed: he found the Hungarians ready to receive him, and prepared to skirmish with his troops, without the walls, as well as to defend the city. Mahomet, finding his arms so resolutely opposed, began to proceed more warily; and intrenched his army. He provided for its safety, against the sudden sallies of the besieged, by casting up deep trenches and strong rampires. After planting his battery, he began to shake the wall of the city most furiously with his great artillery: insomuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground. But the defendants with great labour and industry speedily repaired it, by casting up new fortifications and rampires, so that it was stronger than before.</p>
    <p>Campestran, a Franciscan monk, having at this time preached, in Germany, a crusade against the Turks, had collected an army of 40,000 men. With
    <pb n="8" facs="21"/>
    these, his followers, he entered Belgrade to assist in its defence against Mahomet, who was become the terror of all Christendom by his conquests, his enterprising genius, his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age, his indefatigable industry in the pursuit of whatever he undertook, his irresistible courage, his insatiable cruelty, his avowed impiety, his blood-thirstiness, his immeasurable ambition, his impious treachery, and his unrelenting flinty-hearted severity; so that against his ambition there was no mound, on his faith or friendship no dependance, and in his least displeasure death.</p>
    <p>Huniades, who was gone to Upper Hungary, to raise supplies, was expected to sail from Buda, with a fleet of ships and gallies stored with warlike provisions; when Mahomet, having been a month before Belgrade, prepared to give a general assault, although his superstitious troops were much dispirited from the appearance of two comets<note n="*" place="foot">D'Ohsson's Hist. Gen. of the Othoman Empire, vol. 1. p. 539.</note>; and the death of Carazius the Lieutenant-General, who was killed by a canon-shot from the city; which circumstances they considered as prognosticks of ill success. At this time, A. D. 1456, August 5, the fleet of Huniades came in sight, and was met by Mahomet's fleet four miles up the Danube beyond Belgrade.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>IT mocks belief. Huniades arriv'd?</l>
<l>His fleet in sight, engaging with the Turk's?</l>
<l>Demons of air, in whirlwinds scatter both!</l>
<l>Thou roaring Danube whelm them in thy flood!</l>
<l>Destroy Huniades, though, he destroy'd,</l>
<l>Plumed victory should forsake the Christian banner.</l>
<l>And give to Mahomet unbounded empire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="25"/>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>This passionate deportment tends to ruin;</l>
<l>Your bounty has allur'd the people's hearts,</l>
<l>Because they see no motive, but their interest,</l>
<l>Which stimulates your ardour to relieve them;</l>
<l>The mine you dig, should they suspect your purpose,</l>
<l>Would be blown up with danger to yourself.</l>
<l>Let circumspection guard what art has won;</l>
<l>Opposeless is a foe new-crown'd by victory;</l>
<l>Huniades now reigns in every heart.</l>
<l>These succours, swiftly rais'd, and timely come</l>
<l>To their relief, have chang'd the people's murmurings</l>
<l>To joy and gratitude. Should you exclaim</l>
<l>Against their idol, you excite suspicion.</l>
<l>Still in the people's interest seem absorb'd,</l>
<l>Seem joyful that Huniades is come</l>
<l>With fresh supplies to feed their wives and children.</l>
<l>This if he bring them not sows discontent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Curse on his coming! for it gives the lie</l>
<l>To all I prophesy'd of his delay,</l>
<l>And drooping courage. Long has he been seen?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>Three hours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Why instantly was I not told,</l>
<l>When the fleet came in sight? Art thou too leagu'd</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="26"/>With fortune, and my foes, against my wishes?</l>
<l>My favours merit better service from thee;</l>
<l>Thy too late warning leaves me now no power</l>
<l>To form such plans, as should have foil'd his speed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>Vain, fruitless thought! thy passion warps thy judgment.</l>
<l>Thou might'st as well hope to arrest yon Sun</l>
<l>In mid career, as stop this gallant chief,</l>
<l>When ardent in his country's cause he comes.</l>
<l>Yet had I known, my Lord, you would have thank'd</l>
<l>The man who told you that your foe was near,</l>
<l>I could have summon'd you from needed sleep</l>
<l>To see a grateful people mad with joy;</l>
<l>To hear one voice of praise ascend the skies,</l>
<l>That great Huniades, their guardian genius,</l>
<l>Their tutelary God, was come to save them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Peace! for my ill-placed anger taunt me not.</l>
<l>Huniades, the man I fear and envy,</l>
<l>Whom I with deadly hate detest—he comes.</l>
<l>Unsated vengeance fires my soul to phrenzy,</l>
<l>Gods, he triumphant comes! Give me some hope,</l>
<l>Contrive some means, that he may fall my victim!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>Be calm! and opportune event may aid you;</l>
<l>Without supplies the city must surrender.</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="27"/>If now Huniades relieve Belgrade,</l>
<l>The frighted King will strait return to celebrate</l>
<l>His sister's marriage with the Servian prince.</l>
<l>The Princess gone, the Regent's power is sapp'd;</l>
<l>The guardianship of such a peerless gem,</l>
<l>As your fair niece, gives power to rise still higher.</l>
<l>'Tis rumour'd, that his son Corvinus dar'd</l>
<l>To ask her hand—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>How! my niece wed Corvinus?</l>
<l>By heaven she never shall, whilst I have life;</l>
<l>I first would give Belgrade, although the key</l>
<l>Of the Hungarian realm, to Mahomet;</l>
<l>And he would rid me both of son and father.</l>
<l>Huniades! his blood commix with mine?</l>
<l>Corvinus and Agmunda then would mount</l>
<l>My coward nephew's throne, supplanting me.</l>
<l>Accursed scheme! rise every fiend to blast it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>The Regent has himself that danger warded;</l>
<l>Glory, and not ambition, is his God:</l>
<l>He made the Princess, at the altar, swear</l>
<l>Never to wed his son. But other cares</l>
<l>Demand your present thoughts. A hasty council</l>
<l>Has been conven'd; which soon broke up, commanding</l>
<l>Such troops to muster in Saint Julian's Square,</l>
<l>As can be spar'd from duty on the walls.</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="28"/>These, from the western gate, led by Corvinus,</l>
<l>In one vast column, through the Turkish camp,</l>
<l>Must fight their way against redoubling foes;</l>
<l>Whilst with his troops, and hoped supplies, Huniades</l>
<l>Shall disembark. In this their purpos'd sally,</l>
<l>A thousand of your Austrian troops they ask</l>
<l>To march with the rear-guard, and flank the river,</l>
<l>The ground maintaining which the van shall gain,</l>
<l>And their retreat back to Belgrade secure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Ask me to aid the triumph of Huniades?</l>
<l>Bid the wreck'd seaman quit the plank he clings to!</l>
<l>Bid the parch'd wretch, when fever fires his blood,</l>
<l>Part with the cooling beverage from his lip!</l>
<l>'Tis a gross insult to demand my troops;</l>
<l>Not one shall march beneath Corvinus' standard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>Think of the consequence of this refusal.</l>
<l>'Twould sound unpopular, and most suspicious,</l>
<l>That Austria's Regent, the King's guardian,</l>
<l>And his great Uncle too, refus'd his aid</l>
<l>Stores to convey into a town besieged,</l>
<l>Where every citizen eats scanty bread.</l>
<l>Without these succours famine will ensue,</l>
<l>Belgrade must yield, and with it falls a kingdom.</l>
<l>Your aid is not of service to your foe,</l>
<l>But to yourself; worded the people's friend,</l>
<l>You lose their confidence, if in this misery</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="29"/>Your deeds desert them. Let not fury blind you,</l>
<l>Weigh, with your wonted policy, your interest.</l>
<l>Revenge and hate must wait a riper hour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>I know not that; their hour perhaps is <hi>now.</hi></l>
<l>My spirits feel a prescience which prolaims</l>
<l>The balance of my fate aloft is pois'd;</l>
<l>And shall I make the adverse scale preponderate?</l>
<stage>(pauses.)</stage>
<l>Gods! give me empire, let me reign or die!</l>
<l>I would command my fate, nor owe to chance</l>
<l>My envy'd height. Huniades destroy'd,</l>
<l>The Regency of Hungary is mine;</l>
<l>Then, this Boy King, the people will depose:</l>
<l>Huniades, whilst Regent, more defends him</l>
<l>Than could embattled legions arm'd to save him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! the exigence demands despatch,</l>
<l>Zilugo urged me for a speedy answer;</l>
<l>Resolve, lest your delay excite suspicion,</l>
<l>And make him penetrate your secret motive.</l>
<l>I know he views your conduct with distrust,</l>
<l>And lynx-eyed jealousy may view it right;</l>
<l>Unless you warily avoid its ken.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Be thine the craft t'elude his penetration,</l>
<l>Smoothing my answer to a courteous form.</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="30"/>This Governour I fain would win: so tell him,</l>
<l>My troops should in this enterprise take part,</l>
<l>To the last man; but, that I fear the Sultan,</l>
<l>When we shall sally to convoy the succours,</l>
<l>Will try to force the eastern gate by storm.</l>
<l>This and the wall adjacent I must guard.</l>
<l>To draught my troops, should an assault be given,</l>
<l>Would be most certain danger to Belgrade.</l>
<l>I but withhold them for important service,</l>
<l>More perilous far than that which I decline.</l>
<l>Grace this with all the artifice of speech,</l>
<l>And speak me such as he would wish to find me.</l>
<l>To my Lieutenant then the order give,</l>
<l>That Cosmo shall the eastern gate command;</l>
<l>And Hernan's regiment surround the palace.</l>
<l>Report my fears that the Turks mean to storm.</l>
<l>And instantly to arms my Austrians call.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPHO.</speaker>
<l>Is this parade meant but to blind the council?</l>
<l>Or have these preparations other motives?</l>
<l>Instruct me, lest I fail to aid your purpose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>This palace I will seize. My niece the Princess,</l>
<l>Leagu'd with my foes or not, shall be my prisoner</l>
<l>Till I succeed; and, if I fail, my victim.</l>
<l>I must harangue the crowd, distribute money,</l>
<l>Accuse Huniades of breach of faith,</l>
<l>That he has plann'd his son should wed the Princess.</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="31"/>Dethrone my nephew, and usurp his crown.</l>
<l>If this inflame the people, as I wish,</l>
<l>Corvinus and Huniades return'd</l>
<stage>(spoken with insidious meaning.)</stage>
<l>Shall be for treason seiz'd, and thou their guard,</l>
<l>As thou wast Elsinger's. The Monk Campestran,</l>
<l>Fanatic priest, shall writhe beneath my vengeance.</l>
<l>I'll seize the Sword his insolence refus'd me:</l>
<l>Bless'd by the Pope, the people hold it sacred,</l>
<l>Thinking miraculous power attends the wearer.</l>
<l>Campestran shall repent his proud defiance:</l>
<l>Without his aid, sole Regent of this realm</l>
<l>Belgrade shall hail me, and ere long its King.</l>
<l>With thy accustom'd zeal my orders execute.</l>

<l>And save, from Mahomet, his gallant Father,</l>
<l>With those brave troops who may escape the flames.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>The attempt is madness. What, risk our whole force</l>
<l>To save <hi>one</hi> man? Hazard Belgrade for him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZILUGO.</speaker>
<l>Huniades <hi>that One,</hi>—hazard an Empire.</l>
<l>Though gratitude were dumb, yet interest pleads;</l>
<l>For seven score thousand Turks, inur'd to war,</l>
<l>Round our beleaguer'd walls have trenches open'd,</l>
<l>And our own safety now demands his aid.</l>
<l>Who but himself had fought against their fleet</l>
<l>This morn? Yet he, undaunted Chief, engag'd</l>
<l>Their ships at fearful odds. Had victory smil'd.</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="33"/>Boldly must he his landing have made good</l>
<l>I' the teeth of all the Sultan's chosen soldiers.</l>
<l>And after that, although you think it madness</l>
<l>For us to pass athwart the Turkish lines,</l>
<l>Yet he, with not the tenth of half our force,</l>
<l>Would, through their camp, have hewn himself a path;</l>
<l>Then with tir'd troops, from a third battle panting,</l>
<l>Belgrade had been again by him reliev'd.</l>
<l>This godlike man shall we, with coward caution,</l>
<l>Desert, now, when for us, he stands the mark</l>
<l>Of hostile rage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Defeat, in mid career,</l>
<l>His boldness stops; and, with less daring, prudence</l>
<l>Warns us to act, nor, by our ruin, grace</l>
<l>His fall. Huniades, or dead, or captive,</l>
<l>The tottering state must chuse another Regent:</l>
<l>A Nation's praise will that brave man deserve,</l>
<l>Who, in this peril, dares to take the helm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZILUGO.</speaker>
<l>Now, at this stormy crisis, to be Regent</l>
<l>Is to encounter toil and certain danger:</l>
<l>A thankless office, where all may be lost,</l>
<l>And nothing can be won. Much the King's flight</l>
<l>To Frederick's court, the people has displeas'd.</l>
<l>This beardless King, deserting his own cause,</l>
<l>Is grown unpopular. The soldiers fight</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="34"/>Dead-hearted. Yet where great Corvinus leads,</l>
<l>Adoring him, with ready swords they follow.</l>
<l>Another Regent strew'd with thorns will find</l>
<l>His road, unless our well-plac'd choice select</l>
<l>That hero whom the soldiers love and fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>A Regent must be chosen, or this Corvinus,</l>
<l>This boy, will arrogate his Father's power,</l>
<l>Defy the council's orders, waste our strength,</l>
<l>And lose the city of the most importance</l>
<l>In the Hungarian realm. If you should aid</l>
<l>This rash exploit, I shall suspect your loyalty.</l>
<l>Traitors I deem Corvinus, and Huniades,</l>
<l>Who would usurp my infant Nephew's throne.</l>
<l>To guard his rights, I claim the General's truncheon.</l>

<l>My Lord! approaching tow'rds the eastern gate</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>And yet this realm demands my care, Zilugo!</l>
<l>This new alliance with the Prince of Servia,</l>
<l>Will keep the sword for ever in our hands</l>
<l>Against the Turk, who, when he quits Belgrade,</l>
<l>With fire and sword, will ravage Servia,</l>
<l>Which, by the treaty, we are bound to succour.</l>
<l>Huniades has some base views in this;</l>
<l>Some secret tribute, or some promis'd service.</l>
<l>My Niece is sold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZILUGO.</speaker>
<l>Unjust are your suspicions.</l>
<l>The Regent knows no interest, but his Country's;</l>
<l>And Servia, aided by our arms, will prove</l>
<l>Hungaria's bulwark 'gainst the Turk's invasion.</l>
<l>Therefore he gives the Princess to Matthias.</l>
<l>Although her heart in secret loves another;</l>
<l>Yet has his counsel o'er that love prevail'd,</l>
<l>For the state's welfare, and his sovereign's safety.</l>

<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>And can you, Governor! approve this marriage?</l>
<l>The Servian Prince will, like his treacherous father,</l>

<l>Murder'd your Brother, basely, in cold blood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>Had I a Regent's power, I would oppose</l>
<l>This purpos'd marriage: highly I dislike it.</l>
<l>Form'd by Huniades, it hides some treason.</l>
<l>Let my Niece wed with some Hungarian Lord,</l>
<l>Whose service such a high reward may merit.</l>
<l>Amongst the gallant nobles of this realm,</l>
<l>I know not who has from the state, Zilugo!</l>
<l>Such claims to honour as yourself. Your son—</l>

<l>I understand you, Count! I know, my interest</l>
<l>Is, with the Council, of sufficient weight</l>
<l>For such a bribe: and, when inclin'd to sell</l>
<l>Honour and faith, I know a purchaser,</l>
<l>Who, wanting both, would give a prodigal price,</l>
<l>Glut my revenge, and my ambition feed,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT CILLEY.</speaker>
<l>I prize your zeal, and therefore court your friendship.</l>
<l><pb n="24" facs="37"/>'Tis my esteem for you, which makes me chuse</l>

</sp>

<speaker>ZILUGO.</speaker>
<l>It now behoves me bluntly to inform you,</l>
<l>You lose your dignity in these attempts.</l>
<l>Your sanguine temper grasps at unjust power,</l>
<l>Which vested in you would prove dangerous.</l>
<l>The man who asks more than he ought to have,</l>
<l>Must meet repulse. When honest minds are rous'd</l>
<l>To oppose audacity, respect is lost</l>
<l>In that contempt, which, all unfair designs,</l>

<l>Over domestic bliss, destroy'd my hopes;</l>
<l>The Regent heard my suit, but not the Parent.</l>

<l>The Princess, by my Father's firmness aw'd,</l>

<l>Promis'd— Oh horrour! by a solemn Oath,</l>

<l>For her was lighted, ne'er to wed his Son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMPESTRAN.</speaker>
<l>Oh most unjust! an oath like this to exact</l>

<l>She will not see me since her fatal oath.</l>

<l>This marriage with the Turk she must abhor.</l>

<head>SCENE FIRST—<stage>THE TENT OF MAHOMET.</stage></head>
<stage>A magnificent Tent, occupying the greatest part of the stage, in width; its form circular. The outer tent forming a hall of audience. Two doors, at the back of the tent, conducting to the interior part of it. In the middle, between the two doors, a splendid Throne, with a canopy over it; the drapery of the canopy hanging from a large crescent, representing gems. At each side of the tent, near the front, a rich sofa. The side scenes about the tent trees. The scene behind the tent the Turkish Camp; a crescent on the top of each tent.</stage>

<stage>MUSTAPHA, CHUSANES.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CHUSANES.</speaker>
<l>Impatient of my messenger's delay,</l>
<l>I come before he brings me leave of audience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSTAPHA.</speaker>
<l>You will not gain it yet; for disappointment,</l>
<l>Rage, and revenge, possess the Sultan's soul</l>
<l>By turns. His pride is wounded at the thought</l>
<l>Of that disgrace, his fame will now sustain,</l>
<l>Unless Belgrade should fall, by storm, or stratagem.</l>
<l>Now, whilst he vents his rage, he will not see you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHUSANES.</speaker>
<l>My orders from his Highness are imperfect:</l>
<l>And, I suspect, the business of this night</l>
<l>Teems with no common danger to our arms.</l>
<l>Why does he now negotiate for this Princess?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSTAPHA.</speaker>
<l>If she be gain'd, these Christian Dogs will rest</l>
<l>Secure of peace: and, when they find our Fleet</l>
<l>Was burnt, but to molest Huniades,</l>
<l>They will impute this marriage to our fears.</l>
<l>They will exult: but when in midnight wine,</l>
<l>Supine they're drown'd, and unprepar'd to meet us,</l>
<l><pb n="77" facs="90"/>Then shall we thunder, at their half-arm'd walls,</l>
<l>With all our mighty war: at once assault,</l>
<l>And level, their high towers, ere they have time</l>
<l>To weep their falling.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHUSANES.</speaker>
<l>Should they this intent</l>
<l>Suspect, and much I fear they will, we're caught</l>
<l>In our own toils. This policy may fail,</l>
<l>They may refuse the Princess to our Sultan.</l>
<l>Then great advantage does this parley give them.</l>
<l>Ere we can storm, Huniades may land;</l>
<l>Though half our host is gone to stop this Christian.</l>
<l>But what are legions 'gainst this favour'd mortal?</l>
<l>Whose prophet sends him signs, and prodigies<note n="*" place="foot">The bad success of the enterprise against Belgrade was attributed to the appearance of two Comets on the concluding days of that memorable Siege. See D'Ohsson's Hist. Gen. of the Othoman Empire, vol. I. p. 246.</note>,</l>
<l>To affright and terrify the stoutest hearts.</l>
<l>Our soldiers tremble at his hated Voice:</l>
<l>'Tis as the blast of Israfel's <note n="†" place="foot">See Sale's Translation of the KORAN.</note> dread Trump,</l>
<l>To their astonish'd ears: They fly before him,</l>
<l>With the same fatal speed, as will the accursed,</l>
<l>Over the sword-edg'd Sirat †, when fallen Eblis †</l>
<l>Despairing drives them. Our selected men,</l>
<l>Even the Oglani, I beheld at Vascape</l>
<l>Desert our mighty Prophet's holy standard,</l>
<l>By Christian hands defil'd, led on to havock</l>
<l>By fierce Huniades; who, o'er fourscore thousand,</l>
<l><pb n="78" facs="91"/>Of the brave Faithful, there exulting triumph'd;</l>
<l>And with a puny army, far less numerous</l>
<l>Than our great Sultan's train<note n="*" place="foot">The Sultan Amurath had seven thousand Falconers, and seven thousand Huntsmen; and at the head of ten thousand men, Huniades defeated the whole Turkish army, commanded by Amurath in person. At Vascape, at the head of fifteen thousand men, he defeated an army of eighty thousand Turks: and for this signal victory, Te Deum was sung for three days throughout Hungary.</note>, when in the field,</l>
<l>To unbend his mind, he takes his hunting sport.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSTAPHA.</speaker>
<l>Victorious Mahomet now leads the Faithful.</l>
<l>Shall this Belgrade resist that mighty arm,</l>
<l>Which raz'd Imperial Constantine's proud towers?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHUSANES.</speaker>
<l>Another destiny, now frowning, threats us.</l>
<l>Our Fleet was burnt but to prevent its capture;</l>
<l>And, if the Christians, thinking it their fleet,</l>
<l>Should yield to peace, our standard from their towers</l>
<l>May wave; yet if our terms should be refus'd,</l>
<l>The event is doubtful; they can still defy us.</l>
<l>What 'vantage, by a month's blockade, is gain'd?</l>
<l>If, at this time, they knew but their own strength,</l>
<l>What shall we gain? The Christian Dervis aids them:</l>
<l>Corvinus too, that Son of fierce Huniades,</l>
<l>In strength, and years, our youthful Sultan's peer,</l>
<l>Is in Belgrade: his fame and courage equal</l>
<l>His veteran Sire's.—What hope of conquest then</l>
<l><pb n="79" facs="92"/>O'er Men whom, singly, we have found invincible?</l>
<l>Their valour claims that victory, which Heaven</l>
<l>To them predestinates. In vain we strive;</l>
<l>We cannot stem the tide, nor stand its force.—</l>
<l>Will you not tell the Sultan, that his slave</l>
<l>Waits for his further orders?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSTAPHA.</speaker>
<l>As my life</l>
<l>I value, in his present mood, I dare not</l>
<l>Venture, unsummon'd, to appear before him.</l>
<l>"Let none approach me till Zoganus comes,"</l>
<l>Were his commands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHUSANES.</speaker>
<l>One, privileg'd like you,</l>
<l>Might, in such exigence, dispense with orders,</l>
<l>And disobey the injunctions passion gave.</l>
<l>You are the only man who can control him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSTAPHA.</speaker>
<l>I never dar'd but once <note n="*" place="foot">See Knolles, p. 351.</note>: nor dare I now.</l>
<l>It were as safe to face the cannon's mouth,</l>

<l>Hah! say'st thou so.—Be they as princes feasted;</l>

Then give them chains, not death.</l>

<l><pb n="81" facs="94"/>Soul of my Father Amurath! I swear,</l>
<l>The affront thy arms sustain'd from this proud City,</l>
<l>Thy Son shall see aveng'd. This fierce Huniades,</l>

<l>Let fires throughout the camp, ready for midnight,</l>
<l>Be prepar'd. Plant the ordnance 'gainst the postern,</l>
<l>North of the Eastern tower; for there I deem</l>
<l>The wall is most assailable. Let Tura</l>
<l>Lead on the main assault; and his worst troops</l>

<l>Let Isa Beg lead on the Tartar slaves.</l>
<l>To the command of that brave veteran, Cali,</l>
<l>Appoint five thousand chosen Janizaries,</l>

<l>This is a prize well worth a kingdom's contest!</l>

<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Prince! I thy justice claim. The faith of Nations</l>
<l>Is, by thy treacherous servants, violated.</l>
<l>A Truce protected them; but they profan'd</l>
<l>Its sanctity; and from an Altar tore me.</l>
<l>Redress this wrong; give me safe conduct back.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET.</speaker>
<l>Princess! I would forego my throne, my life,</l>
<l>Sooner than part with her, whose charms would add</l>
<l>Splendour to Empire, Paradise to earth.</l>
<l>My faithful servants' zeal deserves my praise;</l>
<l>I sent them for thee; sent them for my Bride.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Thy Bride! Alas! thou know'st not, Prince, the wrong</l>
<l>I have sustain'd; I'm torn from all my soul</l>
<l>Esteems; from all my anguish'd heart holds dear;</l>
<l>Torn, from each social bliss, from life, from joy,</l>
<l>From honour, from the Husband of my love.</l>
<l>Restore me then, to all these sacred ties,</l>
<l>By thy own Christian Mother<note n="*" place="foot">Mary, the Daughter of George, the Despot of Servia.</note>, I conjure thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET.</speaker>
<l>No ties exist which can withstand my claims.</l>
<l>What Husband, Princess! That mean slave, Corvinus,</l>
<l>Shall not exult in such a beauteous Wife,</l>
<l><pb n="90" facs="105"/>Radiant with youth, and love's attractive grace;</l>
<l>More fair than are the Daughters of our Paradise:</l>
<l>Worthy to share in Mahomet's soft retirement,</l>
<l>When war relaxes his stern brow, and gives</l>
<l>An interval of peace, to taste repose:</l>
<l>Then will he joyful wear Agmunda's chains;</l>
<l>And own, no other Deity, but Love.</l>
<l>Oh, to possess thy heart! that when I come</l>
<l>From conquest, thou may'st fly to meet me, chide</l>
<l>My thirst for fame, yet glory in my laurels:</l>
<l>Then tell me, how thou hadst thought, lov'd, dreamt of me.—</l>
<l>I hail thee, charming Princess! my Sultana;</l>
<l>Sweet partner of my Imperial bed and throne;</l>
<l>For, by the Soul of my great Father Amurath,</l>
<l>By this good Sword, I swear<note n="*" place="foot">The following is the Oath of the Turkish Sultans. "By the Immortal God, by the four hundred Prophets, by Mahomet, by my Father's Soul, by my own Children, by the Sword wherewith I am girt, I solemnly swear to perform what I have now promised." This Oath was sworn by Mahomet at the sacking of Constantinople, 1453, three years before the Era of this Tragedy, when he promised the soldiers, that if they could take the City, they should have the spoil of it for three days.</note> ne'er to resign—</l>
</sp>
<stage>(During the greatest part of this speech, the Princess seems absorbed in deep thought, and solemn grief; her eyes bent on the ground. When Mahomet says, "ne'er to resign—" with a sudden burst of anguish and terrour, as of one awaked in a fright, she throws herself at the Sultan's feet.)</stage>
<sp>
<pb n="91" facs="106"/>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>End not thy oath, I solemnly adjure thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>offering to raise her, she rises</hi>).</stage>
<l>'Tis sworn already, I cannot resign thee;</l>
<l>For by my Father's Soul the Oath was sworn,</l>
<l>And 'tis so sacred, did our Prophet live,</l>
<l>Not he himself could with the Vow dispense.</l>
<l>Thou shalt exult in Mahomet's ardent love,</l>
<l>Thy every wish prevented, thy whole life</l>
<l>One splendid feast of sumptuous delight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Since the sole benefit I could accept,</l>
<l>Thou dost refuse; know, in the whole, wide range,</l>
<l>Of all thy power, thou hast nought left to give,</l>
<l>Worthy Agmunda's thanks, except a grave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET.</speaker>
<l>No, beauteous Scorner! no; a tomb ill suits</l>
<l>Thy youth. Whole ages of delight await us;</l>
<l>Thou my Sultana, I thy humble Slave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>I am the Wife of an illustrious Hero:</l>
<l>My hand and heart are to Corvinus given.</l>
<l>Respect the sacred tie of nuptial Faith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET.</speaker>
<l>Fate has dissolv'd it. For you are my Slave.</l>
<l><pb n="92" facs="107"/>Taken in war. When you refus'd my nuptials,</l>
<l>The truce was void. Fate has decreed you mine.</l>

<l>What's thy resistance, to a Monarch's power?</l>
<l>Thy scorn may, to resentment, turn my love.</l>
<l>Thou hast forgotten then, that I am Mahomet?</l>

<l>I, with unspeakable contempt, behold it.</l>

<l>Thou, Mahomet! Thou! appall'd shrink'st shudd'ring,</l>
<stage>(<hi>Mahomet lays his hand on his sabre.</hi>)</stage>
<l>Before a Christian foe, before thy Captive.—</l>
<l>The Daughter of that sceptred Ancestry,</l>
<l>The constant scourge of thy barbarian Race,</l>
<l>Protected by thy fear, defies thy sword;</l>
<l>Disdains thy mercy; she would shew thee none:</l>
<l>The axe of Justice on thy neck should fall,</l>
<l>And rid mankind of Thee! their dire disgrace.</l>

<l>Thou dar'st not take my life.</l>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>Mahomet in a rage draws his sabre, having kept his hand upon it during the latter part of this speech, advancing to strike the Princess, she advances.</hi>)</stage>

<l>Rouse thee to anger, Prince! Do not, when scoff'd,</l>

<l>Wreak thy revenge against an insolent foe,</l>
<l>Who lives, but to revile thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAHOMET.</speaker>
<l>At thy call,</l>
<l>I wake to rage, resentment, and revenge.</l>
<l>Soon I'll repay thee this vindictive scorn.</l>

<l>Thou bidd'st me vengeance take,—and I will take it.</l>
<stage>(Sheaths his sabre. Terrour takes possession of the Princess's countenance for an instant.)</stage>
<l>For thou shalt live. I'll seize by force, proud Woman!</l>

<l>That voice!

It has his form! I think it has.</l>

<l>For Heaven's sake go!</l>

'Tis thy wild thoughts;</l>

<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>No! I hope not—The vision comes to Me.</l>
<l>Thou canst not see it.
<stage>(<hi>Corvinus approaches.</hi>)</stage></l>
<l>Thou shalt have a Grave.</l>
<l>Oh!
<stage>(<hi>She averts, with her hand, the approach of Corvinus, who takes her outstretched hand; she manifests, by the horrour of her looks, first turned to Huniades, then on Corvinus, that she knows how fatally she has been deceived by the account of his death: and, with a piercing groan, dies.</hi></stage></l>

<l>Hope not for peace through unpermitted means,</l>

<l>With wholesome fear, and stand in awe, that Heaven</l>
<l>Its Mercy veils, when the <hi>self-murderer</hi> pleads.</l>
<l>On my grey hairs avenge not thy distress.</l>
<l>The grave awaits me; bid me not go down to it</l>
<l>With added grief,—with fear,—with trembling agony,</l>
<l>That thy rash act, for ever, may divide us.</l>
<l>My Son!

<l>Thy injur'd Country, and thy King demand.</l>
<stage>(In a softened voice.)</stage>
<l>Agmunda's wrongs claim vengeance from my Son.</l>
<stage>(<hi>Corvinus rouses; he kneels and takes hold of Agmunda's hand, as if he were swearing to avenge her wrongs.</hi>)</stage>
<l><pb n="142" facs="157"/>She lov'd thee well.
<stage>(<hi>Corvinus rises.</hi>)</stage>
She lov'd thee for thy valour.</l>
<l>If like a coward, now thou fly'st the field</l>
<l>Of life, Agmunda will in Heaven know care.</l>
<l>Continue what she lov'd, a dauntless Hero,</l>
<l>Firm midst the dangers of terrific war,</l>
<l>Or the stern trials of domestic woe.</l>
<l>Joyless thyself, yet live for others bliss.</l>
<l>O, grant him, Heaven! the patience thou reward'st;</l>
<l>Preserve this comfort for my hour of death,</l>
<l>When I no longer fight my Country's cause,</l>
