<p>LOVE'S FRAILTIES: A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS, AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT-GARDEN.</p>
<p>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT.</p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS, NO. 137, OXFORD STREET.</p>
<p>1794.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THOSE passages that are printed in <hi>Italics</hi> (not including the French) were omitted on the first representation, one excepted, page 66, of which the words that then gave offence are distinguished by capitals. They are thus pointed out that the reader, who in the heat of political zeal has not quite lost his understanding, may examine what there is in them injurious to truth, or the good of mankind, and find it, if he can. In different times and under different feelings, it will appear astonishing that any one of these passages were suppressed, from any apprehension of political resentment: but such was the fact. That the one unwarily retained should excite the anger which was testified is still more astonishing. A sentence so true as to have been repeated in a thousand different modes: for all strong moral truths are subject to such repetition. A sentence that, under a variety of forms and phraseology, is proverbial in all nations. It ought however to be remembered, that the persons offended, though violent, were few. Their intention doubtless was good: the same cannot be affirmed of their intellect.</p>
<p>Those who are acquainted with German literature, and who have read the drama entitled, <hi>Der Deutsche Hausvater,</hi> by the Baron von Gemmingen, will immediately perceive that the author has availed himself of various incidents and thoughts in that piece; though his fable, characters, and denouement are exceedingly different. Others, who wish to satisfy their curiosity but who cannot read German, may find a French translation of that piece in volume VI. of a work entitled <hi>Nouveau Theatre Allemand,</hi> by M. M. Friedel and de Bonneville.</p>

<p>THE reasons which have occasioned the alteration of price in the present comedy ought to be stated to the public. The previous knowledge of men and manners, and the extraordinary efforts of study, time, and talents, which are necessary to produce a play that has but a chance of being sanctioned by the town, are sufficiently obvious. The labourer is worthy of his hire. In the beginning of the present century, the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence. Since that period, the price of paper has been doubled; the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the same ratio; and advertising, which now amounts to a considerable sum, was then a burthen unknown. It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchase of the copy-right, added to the above costs, occasioned plays to be a dangerous speculation. The new tax on paper, in addition to all these, has made it impossible, at the former price, to reward authors, and afford the bookseller a reasonable hope of profit. These considerations have induced an advance of price, at which it is presumed no just reasoner will take offence.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BERNARD.</byline>
<lg>
<l>"PROLOGUES have long been plac'd, like little <hi>a,</hi></l>
<l>"Before that great noun substantive a play:"</l>
<l>Not form'd of winged words, but wanting wings,</l>
<l>"Of common gender, half-no-meaning things:</l>
<l>"Like rag-fair robes, made up, with little skill,</l>
<l>"To suit farce, tragedy, or what you will:</l>
<l>"Mere tasteless bread-crumbs, only fit for stuffing:"</l>
<l>A cringing crew, and vilely prone to puffing:</l>
<l>Beggars, well satisfied, at any rate,</l>
<l>To feed on offals at the public gate:</l>
<l>"Or running footmen," sent with whoop and hollo,</l>
<l>Types of the vapid things that are to follow:</l>
<l>Grace before meat, which, while the dinner cools,</l>
<l>Is twang'd by knaves, and listen'd to by fools.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But let us take, nor waste our little wit,</l>
<l>A single theme, that may our purpose fit.</l>
<l>"Prologues are scouts, that skulk from post to post,</l>
<l>"And scour the field, to watch the adverse host.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Heroes invincible! Left! Right! Front! Rear!</l>
<l>"Embattl'd ranks! ye thrill the soul with fear!"</l>
<l>Wadded with critic spleen <stage>(Pit)</stage> and prim'd with ire,</l>
<l>Charg'd to the muzzle, ready to give fire,</l>
<l>To slaughter some inclin'd, and some to sleep,</l>
<l>"Lo ruthless veterans rang'd, intrench'd chin deep!</l>
<l>"Flanking this fearful centre in a ring, <stage>(Boxes)</stage></l>
<l>"Gay knights and Amazons form either wing!</l>
<l><pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
"Corps of reserve <stage>(Gallery)</stage> drawn up in dread array,</l>
<l>"On yonder heights await the coming fray!"</l>
<l>But as you're strong be just, in this fierce battle,</l>
<l>Ye godlike men of might, and maids of mettle!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Here let us pause: for, ah! 'tis but too true,</l>
<l>Cassandra like, in black prophetic view,</l>
<l>I see the massacres that may ensue!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wit, humour, character, are put to rout!</l>
<l>The prompter breathless, and the actors out!</l>
<l>Quibbles and clap-traps in confusion run!</l>
<l>Slain is a sentiment! Down drops a pun!</l>
<l>Nay plot himself, that leader far renown'd,</l>
<l>Oh shame! dare scarcely stand another round!</l>
<l>"How shall our general dare such danger meet?</l>
<l>"Were it not better, think you, sirs, to treat?</l>
<l>"War honours grant then, as he files away;</l>
<l>"So may he live and fight another day."</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. ESTEN.</byline>
<lg>
<l>AS some poor wand'rer, who with eager flight</l>
<l>Is homeward hurried by the approach of night,</l>
<l>Comes to the deep abyss, o'er which is thrown</l>
<l>Trunk of old oak or wedge of unhewn stone,</l>
<l>Tremendous bridge! which he must venture o'er,</l>
<l>Braving the horrid gulph and cataract roar,</l>
<l>Slippery! abrupt! no hold, no stay, no trust!</l>
<l>The first false step is death! Yet cross he must,</l>
<l>Safely on t'other side looks shivering back,</l>
<l>And palpitating views the dreadful track,</l>
<l>So stands the happy bard, from danger free,</l>
<l>And trembles at his own temerity!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Bold is the man, or little prone to fear,</l>
<l>Who hopes to write what's fit for you to hear;</l>
<l>Conscious what splendid feasts regale this stage,</l>
<l>Prepar'd by other bards, born of another age!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh Congreve! Otway! Shakespear! mighty shades!</l>
<l>Whose genius every realm of thought pervades,</l>
<l>Gifts such as yours, alas! where shall we find?</l>
<l>Words that with living pictures fill the mind!</l>
<l>Extatic imagery! thoughts divine!</l>
<l>And volumes utter'd in a single line!</l>
<l>But ah! of them and of their heav'nly lays</l>
<l>Fools to remind you, by presumptuous praise!</l>
<l>Dropt be the sacred veil we've rashly dar'd to raise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What can be done? Were will like wishing free,</l>
<l>Various and rich should each fresh banquet be:</l>
<l>Emralds and pearls dissolv'd in liquid gold,</l>
<l>Had we the alchymy, were yours tenfold!</l>
<l><pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
Like those poor Arabs who in deserts live,</l>
<l>The little that we have we freely give.</l>
<l>Finding what may but chance to please your taste,</l>
<l>We serve the morsel up with eager haste:</l>
<l>Happy in this, you know our good intent,</l>
<l>And take in honest part what honestly is meant.</l>

<head>SCENE I. <stage>The House of Sir <hi>GREGORY OLDWORT.</hi></stage></head>
<stage>SEYMOUR, <hi>Lady</hi> LOUISA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>I WILL not hear you, Louisa. In love yourself with a man destitute of rank and fortune, ought you to school me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>A man of family, brother, though not of rank.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Pennyless: a lieutenant in a marching regiment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>But possessed of honour, worth, and virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>And who has more honour worth and virtue than my Paulina?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>A painter's daughter, Charles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>A divinity! Her beauty angelic, her mind godlike!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Thus we lovers rave. The world contains but one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Where is there another Paulina? Encumbered by the absurdities of folly, disguised by the
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
ridiculous trappings of fashion, where shall the sincere, the simple, the affectionate heart be found? I enter the tumultuous assemblies of the idle and all is vanity, all affectation, all incoherency. This hubbub of incongruous and despicable passions but maddens my mind: and, by the contrast, irradiates the abode of peace and Paulina.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Charles, you forget our dependent situation; our family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Our fools and tyrants. An elder brother, whose rank wealth and power, instead of affording us protection, have been made the passports of folly and vice; and an uncle, whose benevolence is self love; who has given us shelter only to make us slaves; at once a cynic and a sensualist; severe to others, indulgent to himself; arbitrary in principle, libidinous in practice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Alas, too true! Sir Gregory pardons nobody's faults but his own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Did he not suffer his sister to languish and die in penury in a foreign land? And what was her crime? Marriage, with a man of a noble mind; but who had the misfortune to be poor and unprotected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>'Tis that makes me shudder! The very same fate is impending over our heads.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Let it fall; at least on me. Injustice to myself shall not make me unjust to others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but there's the question. Your poor painter's daughter may, considering the indigence in which she has been bred, be the phoenix you think her; but can you Charles honestly aver she is the equal of Lady Fancourt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Her superiour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Not to dwell on rank fortune
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
fame and power, which she so eminently possesses and which surely are something—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Bawbles! The gewgaws of fools!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Is the mind of Paulina equally cultivated; equally penetrating strong and towering?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>More! More!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Charles!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>By heavens, more!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Lady Fancourt is a woman of ten thousand!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>I grant it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>She has conceived a partiality for you; Sir Gregory has discovered it, and is determined on the match.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>And I am determined it shall never take place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>For my sake, think again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>At your request, I have already been torturing Paulina and myself: I have not seen her for a week; an excruciating eternal week. But I will be guilty of this cruel injustice no longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Remember your own principles, Charles, remember truth. We must not with the avarice of egotism live for self, but for society. You have duties to mankind, for the fulfilling of which you ought not to be disabled by the indulgence of passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>I own it; and the doubts of what these duties are, haunt and perturb my mind incessantly, render me undecided, cause me every hour to form a thousand contradictory plans, and, instead of making me active and firm, murder resolution and torment me into restless suspence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Opinion is the slave of error, the
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
world is the slave of opinion, and we are the slaves of the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>'Tis your situation, Louisa, that rivets my shackles, which else I would break, and brave the world's injustice and an uncle's tyranny. But I know your affection for Mr. Compton, I am sensible of his worth, and I cannot dare not abandon you to the wretchedness I foresee, should I disobey Sir Gregory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p><stage>(In tears)</stage> Charles!—Your kindness is killing: I can endure any thing but that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>And why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I do not deserve it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I have deceived you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Which way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>For this fortnight my heart has been bursting with a secret, which my tongue has not dared to utter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Heavens!—I guess—I forebode—You are married?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Why then 'tis past—You have got the start of me—I have hesitated, you have resolved; and Paulina, the affectionate pure hearted noble minded Paulina must be sacrificed, or poverty persecution contempt and misery must be the fate of all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I am a selfish wretch, and deserve the worst that can befall me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>No no—Where is your husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Looking round)</stage> For heaven's sake, beware.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Well well, where is Mr. Compton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>On duty with his regiment in Yorkshire, to which he was suddenly ordered, and as I suspect by the management of Sir Gregory—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Who not only threatens but acts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>He has written to me concerning Mr. Compton, and with such severity! He has quite killed the little hope I had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>I expect his arrival from the country every minute. Disperse your gloom: be chearful.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>A smiling face with an aching heart is a painful task—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>But now more than ever necessary. His preaching and his practice are so opposite that he dreads detection and hates ridicule. You have the art to keep him in some awe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I had, but want the courage now to practice it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Nay nay, but you must—Oh, Paulina!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>

<p><stage>(To a footman)</stage> Take this coat. Dust enough! The roads are as crowded as the streets; and have no less hurry, noise and insolence.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>A mob is always unmannerly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>And the whole world is become a mob. Ah, what different beings were our brave ancestors, the bold barons!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Ay, uncle! How delightful it is to contemplate their venerable figures, in old Gothic cathedrals!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Kneeling in marble, with their huge helmets, long swords, alabaster ruffs, grim beards, and gruff faces; that seem to bid you keep your distance, or damme! they will rise and knock you down, as soon as they have done praying.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>And yet, somehow, a little modish politeness, and delicacy—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I hate the words! They are outlandish, contraband, and were imported in some damned cargo of fans, muffs, fringed nightcaps, and chicken gloves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I own it would be diverting to see a modern <hi>petit-maitre</hi> in a coat of mail!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! He would melt under it like a man of snow before the sun! A coat of mail? A coat of pink tiffany! A degenerate—Ah!—I have not patience! A robust hearty fellow, that speaks what he thinks, eats when he is hungry, and fights when he is angry, is called barbarian! horrid brute! And the sight of such a phenomenon would infallibly throw a whole assembly, men, women, and fiddlers, into hysterics.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside to Charles observing him in a reverie)</stage> Charles!—Where are your thoughts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Where they ought never to be; yet there they always are!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>No, no; the disease has attacked the vitals! The blood of our nobles is contaminated. All rank, all order, all distinction is lost! Dukes and jockeys, earls and hop-dealers, peers and pickpockets, all mingle, indiscriminately, and hold their nightly orgies at a hazard table!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Calculation, uncle, is the wisdom of the age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Yes, he is most learned who best knows the odds; and he most renowned, who

fleeces his fellows with the greatest adroitness!—Have you seen Lady Fancourt today? <stage>(To Charles)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>'Tis too early, sir.</p>

<p>I had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>And how came they to be disobeyed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Because commanding is less difficult than obedience.</p>

<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I declare, uncle, you are so severe, you frighten one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Sternly)</stage> Have you received my letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Ay, that too was severe enough!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Madam—!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Compton is a gentleman.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Without rank, connexions, or estate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>His heart and understanding—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p><stage>(With great determination and severity)</stage> If I hear another word concerning him, you shall quit this house and my protection for ever!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p><stage>(After a struggle resuming her temper)</stage> Well; we all have our failings!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I would have you both beware!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>My brother and I are young; we have some excuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Because, being young and foolish, you neglect the advice, and disobey the commands, of the experienced and wise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Why, if the experienced and wise are as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>As what?—What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't be alarmed, uncle!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I!—Alarmed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I insist—! Such calumny, sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>That you steal out by twilight, and, if you see a cap and apron in the square, you hobble after with a—Hem! Hist! Pretty maid! Where are you going? Where do you live? Don't be in such a hurry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I! I!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>That you buy silk purses by the dozen, and put five new half guineas into each, and that, for want of better conversation, you ask every girl you can come up with if she is a good sempstress, for you have always plenty of needle-work.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I! I needle-work!</p>

<p>Was ever such malignity? I—!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>And that you press them by the hand, pat their cheeks, tweak their chins, and fondle them, as Lady Mary Muzzy does her fat lapdog.</p>

<sp>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! What vexed, baronet?</p>

<p>Such malice, sir, is insufferable.</p>

<p>Afraid Charles should hear? You must commit him to me, Sir Gregory. He has spirit and fire, though rather rusticated; but my instructions, and a little polite varnish, will soon display

those bold tints and original touches, which a bad light and a college education have obscured.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>He has already profited by your lessons, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Lady Fancourt, herself, made the same remark but yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Charles is become a favourite with her ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't be jealous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Jealous? Ha, ha, ha! That is excellent! I jealous! Am I not an adept in all the delightful follies of fashion? Do I not lead the mode, and make those dear whims which are ridiculous in others graceful and captivating in me? Am I not in debt to all the town, in love with all the women, envied by all the men, stared at by the world, laughed at by the little, imitated by the great, hated by the awkward, and hooted by the mob? Have I not ruined fifty tradesmen and five Jews? Nay, have I not been ruined myself these three years, and do I not live in as high a style as ever? Ha, ha, ha! I jealous! If I cannot pretend to a lady's favours, who can?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Well, well; if you are certain you are not jealous—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Oh very certain—But, now, tell me, seriously, Lady Louisa—Do you think Charles is—a favourite?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>With Lady Fancourt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Mr. Muscadel, I appeal to your own penetration. You are a man of wit and discernment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Why—I own—Ha, ha, ha! What foolish thing, now, am I going to own?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>A thousand—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>You <hi>may</hi> own; and have a thousand to spare.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>No—No—I, of all others, I am the—the man of her heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Seriously?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Seriously.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>No—No—'Tis impossible—Let us forget it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Do; if you can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Can? Ha, ha, ha! That is very good! Hay, Sir Gregory?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay; vapour away. Your character is pretty well understood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>So much the better. People of merit lose nothing by being known. Day-light or dark, a diamond will sparkle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>And you, Mr. Muscadel, always shine. Like a lamp-reflector, you absolutely blaze us blind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Sitting or standing, riding or walking, I do every thing with a grace. See me take out my handkerchief, put on my gloves, pick up a fan, present a bouquet, dangle in my chair, loll in my chariot; the most trifling actions are made interesting by my manner. Nay, I even sleep like a gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>I think, Mr. Muscadel, it is now six years since you came to your estate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>You are right. It was a great epocha! My father died in the morning, I was in full possession before noon, in the evening I had an assignation with a beautiful woman, was caught by the husband in her bedchamber, appointed to exchange a shot with him at five the next morning, lost half my fortune at White's in
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
the interim, met my man, lodged a bullet in his body, sent an attested account of the affair to the papers, took post for Dover, and enjoyed a hearty supper, my bottle of Burgundy, a French <hi>chanson d'amour,</hi> and a sound sleep, the next night at Calais.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>While your father and the man you had wronged lay stretched on their bier!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Um—No: as it happened, the gentleman mended, in spite of me and the doctors: the news was sent me, we became the best of friends, and in six weeks I had the pleasure to wish him joy of his recovery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>After seducing his wife, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Was it my fault that she was handsome, and I irresistible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Ha! You may well be a favourite with the ladies!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes: I can't help it. No more can they. I have a smile for one, a nod for another, a wink for a third, a hem and a how do you do for a fourth, and she who gets a squeeze of the hand from me thinks herself in heaven!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>And you really have no fear of a rival, with Lady Fancourt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>A rival? Ha, ha, ha! Rival?—Charles is gallant—Her ladyship is polite—but—Oh, no▪ she is too fond of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Past doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>How do you know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>She told me so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>What, herself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Herself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>With her own lips?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Lips? Ha, ha, ha! No; the lips often deceive; the eyes never.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Be not too confident; there are coquettes in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>I know it; I am one. How do you like me, Sir Gregory?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Not at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! No?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>You are a modern man of fashion; a beau, whose characteristic it is to babble; though you know little of what you say, and less of what you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>And you are a bully, of the old school: a kind of walking machine, to grind down beef.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> Baboon!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>You are an old bachelor, too; and have been all your life preaching continence, and practicing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Suddenly)</stage> Sir, I must beg you will not, any more, make free with my moral character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Fie, Mr. Muscadel! There is nothing of which Sir Gregory is so chary as his moral character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Niece—!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Egad, it is very true: a fair character, like a fair skin, if closely inspected, has a thousand irregularities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Significantly)</stage> Ay, like the purple bloom on a fresh gathered plum, it must be admired, not touched: if you handle it, you destroy its beauty—Don't you, uncle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Your character and mine, baronet, are certainly very opposite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Or I would hang myself! You pretend to wit; but, like booksellers, you deal in what you don't understand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! You are an eight day clock, wound up once a week; a fixed star, that every fool knows where to find; an evergreen, always of
<pb n="14" facs="21"/>
one colour: a parish clerk, whose whole vocabulary begins and ends in amen. I am a camelion; an English April-day; a comet, that always appears in a blaze, is the talk of the town, the terror of married men, and the admiration of the whole world! While everybody is enquiring whence it comes, how long it stays, where it goes, and when it returns?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>You affect singularity, Mr. Muscadel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>No: it is natural to me. We men of fashion are always leading the canaille into absurdities, purposely to laugh at them. We are a kind of Will with a wisp; we glitter and entice the gazer into a bog, and there leave him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Come, come; I must begone, to dress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Ah! you are rare animals!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Meteors, Sir Gregory; which you terrestrials may gaze at, but cannot reach: a kind of rainbow, the splendor of which everybody admires, but nobody can equal. <stage>[Exeunt.</stage></p>

<p>True. The lord to whom I sent a pair of pictures has appointed to see me. I must go. Yet why? I shall gain no admittance. Not at home, is the everlasting answer. The insolent porter will scarcely open the gate wide enough for my hand to enter. But I am poor, and must wait, and come again, and again, and take affronts patiently. So it is. The lord within, sits in state, reveling, banqueting, and tantalizing the palled appetite; while the wretch without, repulsed, insulted, and refused his due, is perhaps perishing with hunger!</p>

<p>'Tis true I have sacrificed, as I ought, fifty of the finest women in England to her ladyship's superior charms.</p>

<p>I thought, Mr. Muscadel, what had just passed would have relieved me from such insulting freedoms.</p>

<p>Do you, Mr. Muscadel, or do you not, remember what has been said?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly, my lady. Courage, Charles! I am sorry I am obliged to leave you. You will be very dull when I am gone. Talk, man, talk! Don't stand studying half an hour for a civil thing; looking as stupid as a poet in search of a simile, and as inanimate as a wooden lion at the head of a Dutch ship.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady F.</speaker>
<p>The entertainment, sir, which consists in gratifying spleen at the expence of feeling, is not very enviable.</p>

were in my life. Never—But I am sorry to punish you both, by leaving you together. You will soon miss me! Charles, don't begin to yawn too soon. And let me tell you a secret, before I go. Woman, you know, is a riddle: the solution to which is, you must either use her very ill, or be treated worse by her than a straggling hound by a whipper-in. La, la, la, la. Good-morrow to your ladyship. Don't think I am splenetic. Ha, ha, ha! I am not jealous, Charles. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

How then can we answer it to our relations, or the world, if, seduced by some fancied beauties of person, perhaps by the mere accident of complexion, which a frosty air gives and a gloomy day destroys, looking no deeper, we turn from prosperity and wilfully embrace ruin; in which we not only involve ourselves but all who are nearest and dearest to the heart?</p>

Where is the beloved of my soul? Has he forsaken me? Oh, no! Detested be the unjust the ungenerous thought! Come, in pity come, lest phrenzy suddenly seize on thy Paulina!"—Poor dear girl!—What can be done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Something dreadful! Something that shall teach youth the horrid torments attendant on deceit; that shall make me a fearful example of blind, rash, unequal love!</p>

<sp>

<p>Charles! Collect your thoughts. Terror and distraction may increase, but cannot cure, evil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>And must I then live and die a perjured wretch?—A monster?—Oh the villany of rashness! Did you know how I laboured, intreated, threatened, wept, swore! Solemn oaths, wild phrenzies, desperate threats, no horror had been left unacted had she persevered in rejecting me! What then had she been faithless, perjured as I am? Oh! Madness!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Sir Gregory's suspicions have induced him to continue his visits to her: she had just received a letter for me, had stript off the cover and laid it for a moment on her dressing table: Sir Gregory abruptly came in, saw the direction, "to Lady Louisa Compton," snatched it up, and deaf to the intreaties of poor Miss Compton refused to return it, determined he said to deliver it himself.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Works addressed to the imagination are unworthy of praise, unless they have some moral purpose.

<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Yes—Perhaps the partiality of a father led me to suppose the form and countenance of my Paulina miraculously adapted to my subject—But observe—The scene is a cave <stage>(Pointing)</stage> an overhanging rock, a gloomy forest in the back ground, some broken lights and distances on the left, and a deep gulph in front: the heroine here, here the confidante, and here the only guardian they dared to trust, a faithful mastiff. Observe these traits. Behold her, with all her native candor and confidence,
<pb n="52" facs="59"/>
waiting for her expected lover, and imagining all his superior qualities of soul; while the godlike picture her fancy forms, of him and his high deserts, beams in her eyes, and illuminates her countenance!—How shall I pourtray the agony of a heart so pure and unsuspecting, when the fearful moment comes? Is it not an interesting subject?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>A subject of terror! Horror! Madness!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Quitting the picture)</stage> Yes, madness is one of its principal features—After depicting the dreadful conflict, when she hears the perjured seducer is on the eve of marriage with another, after shewing her in all the agonies of despair, imploring at his feet—perhaps at the feet of his mistress—</p>

<stage>[Paulina appears to be suddenly struck, at this moment, with her father's thought; which she must express in action, and run precipitately out of the chamber-door, that leads to the street.

Craig wholly absorbed by his subject]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>

<p>Yes; and has enquired for you: appears much disturbed, and resolves again to visit Paulina.</p>

<p>For what purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes, last night.</p>

<p>Blame? Noble-minded, much injured girl! Still I dread the unfeeling Sir Gregory.</p>

<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seym.</speaker>
<p>I tremble to discover, yet am on the rack till I know. Be the consequences what they will, I am determined rather to relinquish life than Paulina. I wish therefore to avoid Lady Fancourt, till her mind is more calm.</p>

<speaker>Lady L.</speaker>
<p>Away then. I will be ready, if any thing should happen.</p>

<head>SCENE II. <stage>The Painting-room.</stage></head>
<stage>Sir <hi>GREGORY</hi> sitting to <hi>CRAIG</hi> for his portrait.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Then you think the men of former ages were guilty of as great vices as those of the present?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Keep your mouth▪ shut—Greater: but they did not make a system of vice; they were hurried into it by their passions. Theirs were the crimes of men. There is a disgraceful a contemptible meanness in the vices, as well as the persons of
<pb n="62" facs="69"/>
the present puny race; and neither their passions nor their bodies have sufficient prowess to make them commit acts, that can entitle them to respect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Rises with animation)</stage> If they fight a duel, it is not in the heat of anger, and desire of revenge; but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet, or sip a dish of tea: ay and as little danger, too; for, as they manage the matter, there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and steel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Why as to the merit, or virtue, of fighting duels, either in the old mode or the new, I believe we had better not talk of that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>The vestiges of ancient independence are wearing away. It makes my very heart ache to see the poor remains of towers, that once defied the fury of tyrants, and the war of elements, lye mouldering in ruins.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>If we erect a building, now, it is in such a light, frippery, unsubstantial style, that a pistol bullet would demolish it. A castle of cobwebs, spun in July, and brushed away in November.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you are a man of sense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>And, as to our commerce, we have poisoned the people with our teas, spices, and spirits. We send to China for pipkins, to Hudson's Bay for cat's skins, to Venice for window alias vice blinds, and to Leghorn for toothpicks and fiddlestrings: and, that the lower part of the community may not have the power to reproach and despise their leaders, vice, disease, and destruction are imported in ship loads, and parceled out in pennyworths.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>
<p>Sir, your conversation pleases me. Hem! When will your daughter be within?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Presently, presently.</p>

<p>I should be glad to see if she be as handsome as you have painted her.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Certainly. Why not?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Greg.</speaker>

<p>I don't choose to be seen. If any body should come, I'll step in there.</p>

<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Will you? You must ask my leave, first.</p>

<p>I wish she would come! I am quite impatient to see her.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I said Craig.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>Yes, there was Jones of Flintshire, colonel of the Welch Fuzileers: very much of a gentleman, and ruined more farmer's daughters than any ten men in the regiment. I suppose you are his natural son, mister—Jones.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Enraged)</stage> Sir!—I know nothing of Jones, Flintshire colonels, or Welch Fuzileers: my name is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p>True. And so the colonel put you to a painter? A slight premium, and a quick riddance. He managed his pleasures with economy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Musc.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Stopping his ears and staring at him)</stage> I know it, mister—Jones. The colonel told me the whole story. Your mother was the daughter of a Denbighshire drover, who dealt largely in potatoes, pigs, and poultry. A devilish handsome hussey! The colonel was fond of her, brought her to town, and for a whole winter cut a high figure with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Craig.</speaker>
<p>With my mother, sir?</p>
</sp>
