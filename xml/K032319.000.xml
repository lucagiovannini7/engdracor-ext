<p>THE WONDER: A Woman keeps a SECRET. A COMEDY. As it is Acted at the <hi>Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane.</hi> By Her MAJESTY's Servants.</p>

<p><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Dedication, which I always intended to Address to your <hi>HIGHNESS,</hi> and which
<pb facs="4"/>
I was in hopes might have Congratulated you upon your being in <hi>England,</hi> must now wait for your Arrival. I am sure I speak the Sense of every honest <hi>Briton,</hi> when I say that we expect it with the utmost Impatience.</p>
<p>Your Highness, who has been hitherto a Stranger among us, cannot easily conceive the Confidence we repose in you; and it will, perhaps, hardly be believ'd in future Ages, that the first Report of the Duke
<pb facs="5"/>
of <hi>Cambridge</hi>'s Design to Visit us, should raise the <hi>PUBLICK CREDIT</hi> of the <hi>British Nation.</hi></p>
<p>We are fill'd with Pleasure, to think that the most accomplish'd of <hi>Princes</hi> will perfect himself in the Arts of Government under the Eye, and Direction of the Greatest of <hi>Queens.</hi></p>
<p>If it is possible there shou'd be a Sett of Men among us who can wish to see their Country become a Province of <hi>France,</hi> it is, I think, pretty evident that
<pb facs="6"/>
your Residence in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will soon put an End to such Impious Expectations.</p>
<p>The Law of Nature makes it not improbable that you will one Day reign over us, and what may not our Posterity expect from a Prince who in his early Years distinguish'd himself in the Cause of Liberty, and led their Ancestors on to Victory? The Balance of <hi>Europe</hi> will doubtless be kept steady by that Hand which has already perform'd
<pb facs="7"/>
such Wonders in order to maintain it; our Religion, our Laws, and Civil Rites can be in no Danger under a Prince, who from his Conversation with our Nobility, and his Presence at their most important Debates, will have a perfect Insight into all the Parts of our Constitution.</p>
<p><hi>Britain</hi> shall from hence-forward claim your <hi>HIGHNESS</hi> intirely as her own, and endeavour by the most convincing Proofs of her Love and Respect, to make you
<pb facs="8"/>
forget the Court of your Illustrious Father.</p>
<p>The Pains you have already taken to acquire our Tongue, cannot fail to endear you to every <hi>Englishman;</hi> yet as the Idioms of a Language are the last Things we arrive at, I am in hopes an <hi>English</hi> Comedy will not be thought the most improper Present that could be offer'd to your <hi>HIGHNESS.</hi></p>
<p>There is no doubt but you will soon be made the Subject of more Correct Pens, and receive a just Tribute
<pb facs="9"/>
from the greatest Authors of our Nation: In the mean Time, tho' I am, perhaps, the most unworthy, I have at least one Advantage, that I am the first who have shewn my Respect in this Manner, and sued for your Protection.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>I Don't pretend to write a Preface, either to point out the Beauties, or to excuse the Errors, a judicious Reader may possibly discover in the following Scenes, but to give those excellent Comedians their Due, to whom, in some Measure the best Dramatick Writers are oblig'd. The Poet and the Player are like Soul and Body, indispensibly necessary to one another; the correct Author makes the Player shine, whilst the judicious Player makes the Poet's Fame immortal. I freely acknowledge my self oblig'd to the Actors in general, and to Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> in particular; and I owe them this Justice to say, That their inimitable Action cou'd only support a Play at such a Season, and among so many Benefits. Let this encourage our <hi>English</hi> Bards to Write, furnish but the artful Player with Materials, and his Skill will lay the Foundation for your Fame.</p>
<p>I must again repeat that which I meet with every where, I mean the just Admiration of the Performance of Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> and own that they much out-did in Action the strongest of my Conceptions; for tho' Nature was my Aim in the last Act of this Comedy, yet Nature herself were she to paint a Love Quarrel, wou'd only Copy them.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<head type="sub"><stage>Spoken by <hi>Mr.</hi> MILLS.</stage></head>
<l>OUR <hi>Author</hi> fears the Criticks of the Stage,</l>
<l>Who like Barbarians, spare nor Sex, nor Age;</l>
<l>She trembles at those Censors in the Pit,</l>
<l>Who think good Nature shows a want of Wit:</l>
<l>Such Malice, Oh, what Muse can undergo it?</l>
<l>To save themselves, they always Damn the Poet.</l>
<l>Our Author flies from such a Partial Jury,</l>
<l>As wary Lovers from the Nymphs of <hi>Drury:</hi></l>
<l>To the few Candid Judges for a Smile,</l>
<l>She humbly sues to Recompence her Toil.</l>
<l>To the bright Circle of the Fair, she next,</l>
<l>Commits her Cause, with Anxious Doubts perplext.</l>
<l>Where can she with such hopes of Favour kneel,</l>
<l>As to those Judges, who her Frailties feel?</l>
<l>A few Mistakes, her Sex may well excuse,</l>
<l>And such a Plea, No <hi>Woman</hi> shou'd refuse:</l>
<l>If she succeeds, a <hi>Woman</hi> gains Applause,</l>
<l>What <hi>Female</hi> but must favour such a Cause.</l>
<l>Her Faults,—If such there be:—Then,—pass 'em by,</l>
<l>And only on her Beauties fix your Eye.</l>
<l>In Plays, like Vessels floating on the Sea,</l>
<l>There's none so Wise to know their Destiny.</l>
<l>In this, howe'er the Pilot's Skill appears,</l>
<l>While by the Stars his constant Course he steers;</l>
<l>In this our <hi>Author</hi> does her Judgment shew,</l>
<l>That for her Safety she relies on You.</l>
<l>Your Approbation Fair ones, can't but move,</l>
<l>Those stubborn Hearts, which first you taught to Love:</l>
<l>The Men must all Applaud this Play of ours,</l>
<l>For who dares See with other Eyes, than Yours?</l>

<speaker>FREDERICK.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord <hi>Don Lopez.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>How do you <hi>Frederick?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>At your Lordship's Service, I am glad to see you look so well my Lord, I hope <hi>Antonio</hi> is out of danger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Quite contrary, his Feaver increases they tell me, and the Surgeons are of Opinion his wound is mortal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Your Son <hi>Don Felix</hi> is safe I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>I hope so too, but they offer large Rewards to apprehend him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>When heard your Lordship from him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Not since he went, I forbad him writing till the publick News gave him an Account of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Health, Letters might be intercepted, and the place of his Abode discovered.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Your Caution was good my Lord; tho' I am impatient to hear from <hi>Felix,</hi> yet his Safety is my chief Concern. Fortune has maliciously struck a Bar between us in the Affairs of Life, but she has done me the Honour to unite our Souls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>I am not ignorant of the friendship between my Son and You, I have heard him commend your Morals and lament your want of noble Birth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>That's Nature's fault my Lord, 'tis some comfort not to owe ones Misfortunes to ones Self, yet 'tis impossible not to regret the want of noble Birth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>'Tis pity indeed such excellent Parts as you are Master of, should be eclipsed by mean Extraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Such Commendation wou'd make me vain my Lord, did you not cast in the allay of my Extraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>There is no Condition of Life without its Cares, and it is the Perfection of a Man to wear 'em as easie as he can; this unfortunate Duel of my Son's does not pass without Impression. But since 'tis past Prevention, all my Concern is now, how he may escape the Punishment; if <hi>Antonio</hi> dies, <hi>Felix</hi> shall for <hi>England.</hi> You have been there, what sort of People are the <hi>English?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, the <hi>English</hi> are by Nature, what the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were by Discipline, couragious, bold, hardy, and in love with Liberty. Liberty is the Idol of the <hi>English,</hi> under whose Banner all the Nation Lists, give but the Word for Liberty, and straight more armed Legions wou'd appear, than <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> keep in constant Pay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="15"/>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>I like their Principles; who does not wish for Freedom in all Degrees of Life? Tho' common Prudence sometimes makes us act against it, as I am now obliged to do, for I intend to marry my Daughter to <hi>Don Guzman,</hi> whom I expect from <hi>Holland</hi> every Day, whither he went to take Possession of a large Estate left him by his Uncle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>You will not sure Sacrifice the lovely <hi>Isabella</hi> to Age, Avarice, and a Fool, pardon the Expression my Lord, but my Concern for your beauteous Daughter transports me beyond that good Manners which I ought to pay your Lordship's presence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>I can't deny the justness of the Character <hi>Frederick</hi>; but you are not insensible what I have suffered by these Wars, and he has two things which render him very agreeable to me for a Son-in-Law, he is Rich and well Born; as for his being a Fool, I don't conceive how that can be any Blot in a Husband, who is already possess'd of a good Estate.—A Poor Fool indeed is a very Scandalous thing, and so are your Poor Wits, in my Opinion, who have nothing to be vain of, but the inside of their Sculls; now for <hi>Don Guzman</hi> I know I can rule him, as I think fit; this is acting the Politick part, <hi>Frederick,</hi> without which, it is impossible to keep up the Port of this Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>But have you no Consideration for your Daughter's welfare my Lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Is a Husband of twenty thousand Crowns a Year, no Consideration? Now I think it a very good Consideration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>One way, my Lord. But what will the World say of such a Match?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I value not the World a Button.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>I cannot think your Daughter can have any Inclination for such a Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>There I believe you are pretty much in the right, tho' it is a Secret, which I never had the Curiosity
<pb n="4" facs="16"/>
to enquire into, nor I believe ever shall—Inclination quotha! Parents would have a fine time on't, if they consulted their Childrens Inclinations! I'll venture you a Wager, that in all the Garrison Towns in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> during the late War, there were not three Women, who have not had an Inclination to every Officer in the whole Army; does it therefore follow, that their Fathers ought to Pimp for them? No, no, Sir, it is not a Father's business to follow his Childrens Inclinations till he makes himself a Beggar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>But this is of another Nature my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Look ye Sir, I resolve she shall Marry <hi>Don Guzman</hi> the Moment he arrives; tho' I cou'd not govern my Son, I will my Daughter, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>This Match my Lord, is more preposterous than that which you proposed to your Son, from whence arose this fatal—Quarrel, <hi>Don Antonio</hi>'s Sister <hi>Elvira,</hi> wanted Beauty only, but <hi>Guzman</hi> every thing, but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Money—and that will purchase every thing, and so Adieu.</p>
<stage>(<hi>Exit.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Monstrous! These are the Resolutions which destroy the comforts of Matrimony—he is Rich, and well born, powerful Arguments indeed! Could I but add them to the Friendship of <hi>Don Felix,</hi> what might I not hope? But a Merchant and a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> are inconsistent Names—<hi>Lissardo!</hi> From whence come you?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lissardo <hi>in a Riding Habit.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Liss.</speaker>
<p>That Letter will inform you Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>I hope your Master's safe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liss.</speaker>
<p>I left him so, I have another to deliver which requires—haste—Your most humble Servant Sir <stage>(<hi>bowing.</hi></stage></p>

<p><stage>(<hi>Reads</hi>)</stage> Dear <hi>Frederick,</hi> the two chief Blessings of this Life are a Friend, and a Mistress; to be debarred the sight of those is not to live. I hear nothing of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Death, therefore resolve to venture to thy House this Evening, impatient to see <hi>Violante,</hi> and embrace my Friend. Yours <hi>Felix.</hi></p>

<p>What brought you to <hi>Lisbon</hi> Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p><hi>La Fortune de la Guerre,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> say, I have commanded these Three last Years in <hi>Spain,</hi> but my Country has thought fit to strike up a Peace, and give us good <hi>Protestants</hi> leave to hope for Christian Burial, so I resolve to take <hi>Lisbon</hi> in my way home.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>If you are not provided of a Lodging Colonel, pray command my House, while you stay.</p>

<p>So far from trouble Colonel, I shall take it as a particular Favour, what have we here?</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, a comical Fellow.—Well, how do you like our Country, Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Why Faith <hi>Frederick,</hi> a Man might pass his Time agreeably enough with Inside of a Nunnery; but to behold such Troops of soft, plump, tender melting, wishing, nay willing Girls too, thro' a damn'd Grate, gives us <hi>Brittons</hi> strong Temptation to Plunder. Ah <hi>Frederick,</hi> your Priests are wicked Rogues. They immure Beauty for their own proper Use, and show it only to the Laity to create Desires, and inflame Accompts, that they may purchase Pardons at a dearer Rate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>I own Wenching is something more difficult here than in <hi>England,</hi> where Womens Liberties are subservient to their Inclinations, and Husbands seem of no Effect but to take Care of the Children which their Wives provide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>And does Restraint get the better of Inclination with your Women here? No, I'll be sworn not even in fourscore. Don't I know the Constitution of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>And of all Ladies where you come, Colonel, you were ever a Man of Gallantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ah <hi>Frederick,</hi> the <hi>Kirk</hi> half starves us <hi>Scotchmen.</hi> We are kept so sharp at home, that we feed like Cannibals abroad. Hark ye, hast thou never a pretty Acquaintance now, that thou wouldst consign over to a Friend for half an Hour, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Faith Colonel, I am the worst Pimp in <hi>Christendom,</hi> you had better trust to your own Luck, the Women will soon find you out I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but it is dangerous forraging in an Enemy's Country, and since I have some hopes of seeing
<pb n="7" facs="19"/>
my own again, I had rather purchase my Pleasure, than run the hazard of a <hi>Stilletto</hi> in my Guts. 'Egad, I think I must e'en Marry and Sacrifice my Body for the good of my Soul, wilt thou recommend me to a Wife then, one that is willing to exchange her <hi>Moyders</hi> for <hi>English</hi> Liberty; ha Friend,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>She must be very handsome I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col:</speaker>
<p>The handsomer the better—but be sure she has a Nose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, and some Gold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Oh, very much Gold, I shall never be able to swallow the Matrimonial Pill, if it be not well Gilded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Puh, Beauty will make it slide down nimbly.</p>

<p>At first perhaps it may, but the Second or Third Dose will choak me—I confess <hi>Frederick,</hi> Women are the prettiest Play-things in Nature, but Gold, substantial Gold, gives 'em the Air, the Mien, the Shape, the Grace, and Beauty of a Goddess.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>And has not Gold the same Divinity in their Eyes Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Too often.—Money is the very God of Marriage, the Poets dress him in a Saffron Robe, by which they Figure out the golden Deity, and his lighted Torch blazons those mighty Charms, which encourage us to List under his Banner.</p>

<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>For goodness sake, Madam, where are you going in this Pet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Any where to avoid Matrimony; the thoughts of a Husband is as terrible to me as the sight of a Hobgoblin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Ay, of an old Husband, but if you might chuse for your self, I fancy Matrimony wou'd be no such frightful Thing to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>You are pretty much in the right, <hi>Inis</hi>; but to be forc'd into the Arms of an Ideot, a sneaking, snivling, drivling, avaricious Fool, who has neither Person to please the Eye, Sense to charm the Ear, nor generosity to supply those Defects, ah <hi>Inis!</hi> What pleasant Lives Women lead in <hi>England,</hi> where Duty wears no Fetter but Inclination: The Custom of our Country inslaves us from our very Cradles, first to our Parents, next to our Husbands; and when Heaven is so kind to rid us of both these, our Brothers still usurp Authority, and expect a blind Obedience from us, so that Maids, Wives, or Widows, we are little better than Slaves to the Tyrant Man, therefore to avoid their Power, I resolve to cast my self into a Monastery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>That is, you'll cut your own Throat to avoid another's doing it for you. Ah Madam, those Eyes tell me you have no Nuns flesh about you; a Monastery quotha! Where you'll wish your self in the Green-Sickness in a Month.</p>

<p>Two Moyders! Well he is a generous Fellow this is the only Way to make one careful; I find all Countries understand the Constitution of a Chambermaid.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Was you distracted <hi>Flora?</hi> To tell my Name to a Man you never saw! Unthinking Wench! Who knows what this may turn to—What is the Lady dead! Ah!

<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Hold my dearest Father, do not force me, indeed I cannot love him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>How wild she talks—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Ha! Where am I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>With one as sensible of thy Pain as thou thy self canst be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p><hi>Violante</hi>! What kind Star preserv'd, and lodg'd me here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>It was a Terrestial Star, call'd a Man, Madam; pray <hi>Jupiter</hi> he proves a lucky one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I remember now, forgive me dear <hi>Violante,</hi> my Thoughts ran so much upon the Danger I escap'd, I had forgot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>May I not know your Story?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="31"/>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Thou art no Stranger to one part of it; I have often told thee that my Father design'd to sacrifice me to the Arms of <hi>Don Guzman,</hi> who it seems is just return'd from <hi>Holland,</hi> and expected ashore to-morrow, the Day that he has set to celebrate our Nuptials, upon my refusing to obey him, he lock'd me into my Chamber, vowing to keep me there till he arriv'd, and force me to consent. I know my Father to be possitive, never to be won from his Design; and having no hope left me, to escape the Marriage, I leap'd from the Window, into the Street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>You have not hurt your self I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>No, a Gentleman passing by, by Accident caught me in his Arms; at first my Fright made me apprehend it was my Father, till he assur'd me to the contrary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>He is a very fine Gentleman I promise you, Madam, and a well bred Man I warrant him. I think I never saw a Grandee put his Hand into his Pocket with a better Air in my whole Life Time; then he open'd his Purse with such a Grace, that nothing but his Manner of presenting me the Gold cou'd equal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>There is but one common Road to the Heart of a Servant, and 'tis impossible for a generous Person to mistake it.—But how came you hither <hi>Isabella?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I know not, I desir'd the Stranger to convey me to the next <hi>Monastery,</hi> but e'er I reach'd thy Door, I saw, or fancy'd that I saw, <hi>Lissardo,</hi> my Brother's Man, and the Thought that his Master might not be far off, flung me into a Swoon, which is all that I remember: Ha! What's here <stage>(<hi>takes up a Letter</hi>)</stage> <hi>For</hi> Collonel <hi>Britton, to be left at the Post-House in</hi> Lisbon; this must be drop'd by the Stranger which brought me hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Thou art fal'n into the Hands of a Soldier, take care he does not lay thee under Contribution, Girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I find he is a Gentleman; and if he be but unmarried I cou'd be content to follow him all the World over.—But I shall never see him more I fear. <stage>(<hi>Sighs, and Pauses.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>What makes you sigh <hi>Isabella?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>The fear of falling into my Father's Clutches again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Can I be serviceable to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Yes if you'l conceal me two or three Days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>You command my House and Secrecy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I thank you <hi>Violante,</hi>—I wish you wou'd oblige me with Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> a while.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I'll send for her to you—I must watch if Dad be still asleep, or here will be no room for <hi>Felix.</hi></p>
<stage>(<hi>Exit.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Well I don't know what ails me, but methinks I wish I cou'd find this Stranger out.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Flora.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Does your Ladyship want me Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Mrs. <hi>Flora,</hi> I resolve to make you my Confident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>I shall endeavour to discharge my Duty, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I doubt it not, and desire you to accept this as a Token of my Gratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear <hi>Senjora,</hi> I shou'd have been your humble Servant, without a Fee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I believe it—But to the Purpose—Do you think if you saw the Gentleman which brought me hither you shou'd know him again?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>From a Thousand Madam, I have an excellent Memory where a handsome Man's concern'd; when he went away he said he would return again immediately, I admire he comes not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Here, did you say? You rejoyce me—Tho' I'll not see him, if he comes, cou'd not you contrive to give him a Letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>With the Air of a Duanna.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Not in this House—You must veil and follow him—He must not know it comes from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>What do you take me for a Novice in Love Affairs? 'Tho I have not practic'd the Art since I have been in <hi>Donna Violantes</hi> Service, yet I have not lost the Theory of a Chamber-Maid—Do you write the Letter, and leave the rest to me—Here, here, here's Pen Ink and Paper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I'll do't in a Minute.</p>
<stage>(<hi>Sits down to write.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>So! This is Business after my own Heart; Love always takes care to reward his Labourers, and <hi>Great Britain</hi> seems to be his Favourite Country.—Oh, I long to see the t'other two Moyders with a British Air—Methinks there's a Grace peculiar to that Nation in making a Present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>So I have done, now if he does but find this House again!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>If he shou'd not—I warrant I'll find him if he's in <hi>Lisbon.</hi></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Contrary to your Desire, be assur'd I never shall, but where's the Danger?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Art thou born in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and ask that Question? He'll think his Honour blemish'd by my Disobedience,
<pb n="22" facs="34"/>
and wou'd restore me to my Father, or kill me, therefore dear, dear, Girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Depend upon my Friendship, nothing shall draw thy Secret from these Lips, not even <hi>Felix,</hi> tho' at the Hazard of his love; I hear him coming, retire into that Closet.</p>

<p>If during this tedious painful Exile, thy Thoughts have never wander'd from thy <hi>Felix,</hi> thou hast made me more than Satisfaction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Can there be room within this Heart for any but thy self. No, if the God of Love were lost to all the rest of Human Kind, thy Image wou'd secure him in my Breast, I am all Truth, all Love, all Faith, and know no jealous Fears.</p>
</sp>

I expect you'll not attempt to see my Face, nor offer any thing unbecoming the Gentleman I take you for:—"Humph, the Gentleman she takes me for, I hope she takes me to be Flesh and Blood, and then I am sure I shall do nothing unbecoming a Gentleman. Well, if I must not see her Face, it shall go hard if I don't know where she lives.—<hi>Gibby,</hi></p>

<speaker>Liss.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Looking upon the Ring</hi>)</stage> Not at all—I have some Thoughts indeed of altering my Course of living; there is a critical Minute in every Man's Life, which if he can but lay hold of, he may make his Fortune.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Ha! What, do I see a Diamond-Ring! Where the duce had he that Ring? You have got a very pretty Ring there, <hi>Lissardo.</hi></p>

<p>No, the Devil take me if she did, you make me Swear now—So, they are All for the Ring, but I shall bob 'em: I did but Joke, the Ring is none of mine, it is my Masters; I am to give it to be new Set, that's all, therefore prithy dry thy Eyes, and kiss me come.</p>

<p>So! Now am I as great as the fam'd <hi>Alexander.</hi> But my dear <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> don't exert your selves so much about me: Now, I fancy, if you wou'd agree lovingly together, I might in a modest way satisfie both your Demands upon me.</p>

<p>No, nor I neither.—What do you make no difference between us?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You pitiful Fellow you; what you fancy, I warrant, that I gave my self the trouble of dogging you, out of love to your filthy Person, but you are mistaken, Sirrah—It was to detect your Treachery.—How often have you Sworn to me that you hated <hi>Inis,</hi> and only carried fair for the good Chear she gave you; but that you could never like a Woman with crooked Legs, you said.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>

You silly Girl you; why, I saw you follow us plain enough, Mun, and said all this, that you might not go back with only your Labour for your Pains—But you are a revengeful young Slut tho'.

<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>This from a Person of mean Education were excusable, such low Suspicions have their source from vulgar Conversation; Men of your politer Taste never rashly Censure.—Come, this is some groundless Jealousie.—Love raises many Fears.</p>

<p>Then pray Sir—If I am not too inquisitive, What Motive had you for those Objections you made against her Marriage with <hi>Don Guzman</hi> Yesterday?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>The Disagreeableness of such a Match, I fear'd, wou'd give your Daughter cause to curse her Duty, if she comply'd with your Demands, that was all my Lord!</p>

<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>If your Visit was design'd to <hi>Frederick,</hi> Madam, he is abroad,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>No Sir, the Visit is to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>You are very punctual in your Ceremonies Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Tho' I did not come to return your Visit, but to take that which your Civility ought to have brought me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>If my Ears, my Eyes and my Understanding ly'd, then I am in your Debt, else not Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I will not charge them with a Term so gross, to say they ly'd, but call it a Mistake, nay call it any thing to excuse my <hi>Felix</hi>—Cou'd I, Think ye, cou'd I put off my Pride so far, poorly to dissemble a Passion which I did not feel? Or seek a Reconciliation, with what I did not love? Do but consider, If I had entertain'd another, shou'd I not rather embrace this Quarrel, pleas'd with the Occasion that rid me of your Visits and gave me Freedom to enjoy the Choice which you think I have made; have I any Interest in thee but my Love? Or am I bound by aught but Inclination to submit and follow thee—No Law whilst single binds us to obey, but you by Nature, and Education, are oblig'd to pay a Deference to all Woman kind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>These are fruitless Arguments: 'Tis most certain thou wert dearer to these Eyes then all that Heaven e'er gave to Charm the Sense of Man, but I wou'd rather tear them out, than suffer 'em to delude my Reason, and enslave my Peace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Can you love without Esteem? And where is the Esteem for her you still suspect? Oh <hi>Felix</hi>! There is a Delicacy—in Love, which equals even a religious Faith; true Love ne'er doubts the Object it adores, and Scepticks there, will disbelieve their Sight.</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Not a Step; your Master shan't be put to the Blush—Come a Truce <hi>Felix</hi>! Do you ask me no more Questions about the Window, and I'll forgive this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I scorn Forgiveness where I own no Crime, but your Soul conscious of its Guilt, wou'd fain lay hold of this Occasion to blend your Treason with my Innocence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Insolent! Nay, if instead of owning your Fault you endeavour to insult my Patience, I must tell you Sir, you don't behave your self like that Man of Honour you wou'd be taken for, you ground your Quarrel with me upon your own Inconstancy; 'tis plain you are false your self, and wou'd make me the Agressor—It was not for nothing the Fellow oppos'd my Entrance—This last Usage has given me back my

<p>Oh, stubborn, stubborn Heart, what wilt thou do? Her Father's Will shall be obey'd! Ha, That carries her to a Cloyster, And cuts of all my Hopes at once—By Heaven she shall not, must not leave me.

<p>It, it it, was Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> Sir. <hi>Donna Violante</hi>'s Woman—you must know Sir, we have had a sneaking Kindness for one another a great while—She was not willing you should know it, so when she heard your Voice, she ran into the Cloaths Press, I wou'd have told you this at first, but I was afraid of her Lady's knowing it, this is the Truth as I hope for a whole Skin, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>MY Dear, I have been seeking you this half Hour, to tell you the most lucky Adventure.</p>

<p>And mine all to come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I have seen the Man I like.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>And I have seen the Man that I cou'd wish to hate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>And you must assist me in discovering whether he can like me, or not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>You have assisted me in such a Discovery already, I thank ye.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>What say you my Dear?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I say I am very unlucky at Discoveries <hi>Isabella</hi>; I have too lately made one pernicious to my Ease, your Brother is false.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Impossible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Most true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Some Villain has traduc'd him to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>No, <hi>Isabella,</hi> I love too well to trust the Eyes of others; I never Credit the ill judging World, or form Suspicions upon vulgar Censures; no, I had Ocular Proof of his Ingratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="47" facs="59"/>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Then I am most unhappy; my Brother was the only Pledge of Faith betwixt us, if he has forfeited your Favour, I have no Title to your Friendship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>You wrong my Friendship, <hi>Isabella</hi>; Your own Merit intitles you to every thing within my Power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Generous Maid—But may I not know what Grounds you have to think my Brother False.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Another time.—But tell me, <hi>Isabella,</hi> how can I serve you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Thus then—The Gentleman that brought me hither, I have seen and talk'd with, upon the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi> this Morning, and find him a Man of Sense Generosity, and good Humour, in short he is every Thing that I cou'd like for a Husband, and I have dispatch'd Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> to bring him hither; I hope you'll forgive the Liberty I have taken.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Hither, to what Purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>To the great universal Purpose Matrimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Matrimony! Why do you design to ask him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>No, <hi>Violante,</hi> you must do that for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I thank you for the Favour you design me, but desire to be excus'd: I manage my own Affairs too ill, to be trusted with those of other People; besides, if my Father shou'd find a Stranger here, it might make him hurry me into a <hi>Monastery</hi> immediately; I can't for my Life admire your Conduct, to encourage a Person altogether unknown to you.—'Twas very Imprudent to meet him this Morning, but much more so, to send for him hither, knowing what Inconveniency you have already drawn upon me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I am not insensible how far my Misfortunes have embarrrast you; and if you please, sacrifice my Quiet to your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Unkindly urg'd—Have I not preferr'd your Happiness to every Thing that's dear to me.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I know thou hast—Then do not deny me this last Request, which in a few Hours perhaps, may render

my Condition, able to clear thy Fame, and bring my Brother to thy Feet for Pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I wish you don't repent of this Intrigue. I suppose he knows you are the same Woman that he brought in here last Night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Not a Syllable of that, I met him vail'd, and to prevent his knowing the House, I order'd Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> to bring him by the back Door into the Garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>

<p>That is indeed a weighty Consideration, well, what am I to do.</p>

<p>Purchase!

<p>Nay, don't give your self the trouble of drawing your Purse Colonel, my Design is level'd at your Person, if that be at your own disposal.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ay, that it is Faith Madam, and I'll settle it as firmly upon thee.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>As Law can do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Hang Law in love Affairs, thou shalt have Right and Title to it out of pure Inclination.—A Matrimonial Hint again! Gad, I fancy the Women have a Project on foot to transplant the Union into <hi>Portugal.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Then you have an aversion to Matrimony, Colonel; did you never see a Woman, in all your Travels, that you cou'd like for a Wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>A very odd Question.—Do you really expect that I shou'd speak Truth now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I do, if you expect to be so dealt with, Colonel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why then,——Yes.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="62"/>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Is she in your own Country, or this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>This is a very pretty kind of a Catechism; but I don't conceive which way it turns to Edification: In this Town I believe Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Her Name is.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ay, How is she call'd, Madam!</p>

<p>Nay, I ask you that, Sir.</p>

<p>Oh, ho, why she is call'd—Pray Madam, how is it you Spell your Name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Colonel, I am not the happy Woman, nor do I wish it.</p>

<p>No, I'm sorry for that.—What the Devil does she mean by all these Questions?<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Come Colonel, for once be Sincere.—Perhaps you may not repent it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Faith Madam, I have an Inclination to Sincerity, but I'm afraid you'll call my Manners in Question: This is like to be but a silly Adventure, here's so much Sincerity required. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Not at all; I prefer Truth before Compliment in this Affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Why then to be plain with you, Madam, a Lady last Night wounded my Heart by a Fall from a Window, whose Person I cou'd be contented to take, as my Father took my Mother, till Death us doth part:—But who she is, or how distinguish'd, whether Maid, Wife, or Widow I can't inform you, perhaps you are she.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Not to keep you in suspence, I am not She, but I can give you an Account of Her; that Lady is a Maid of Condition, has ten Thousand Pounds; and if you are a single Man, her Person, and Fortune are at your Service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I accept the Offer with the highest Transports; but say my charming Angel, art thou not she. <stage>(<hi>offers to Embrace her.</hi>)</stage> This is a lucky Adventure. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, he comes that way, how shall I prevent their Meeting? Here, here, step into my Bed-Chamber and be still, as you value her you love; don't stir till you've Notice, as ever you hope to have her in your Arms.</p>

<p>Since we are to part, <hi>Felix,</hi> there needed no Justification.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Methinks you talk of parting, as a Thing indifferent to you; can you forget how I have lov'd?</p>

<p>I wish I cou'd forget my own Passion; I shou'd with less Concern remember yours.—But for Mrs. <hi>Flora.</hi>—</p>

<p>You must forgive her;—Must did I say? I fear I have no Power to Impose, tho' the Injury was done to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>'Tis harder to Pardon an Injury done to what we love than to our selves, but at your Request, <hi>Felix,</hi> I do forgive her; go watch my Father, <hi>Flora,</hi> least he shou'd wake, and surprize us.</p>

<p>What need of Repetition from my Tongue, when every Look confesses what you ask?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Let no Man judge of Love but those who feel it, what wondrous Magick lies in one kind Look.—One tender Word destroys a Lover's Rage, and melts his fiercest Passion into soft Complaint. Oh the Window, <hi>Violante,</hi> woud'st thou but clear that one Suspicion!</p>

<p>No, because I find they have deceiv'd me; well, I am convinc'd that Faith is as necessary in Love as in Religion; for the Moment a Man lets a Woman know her Conquest, he resigns his Senses, and sees nothing but what she'd have him.</p>

<p>What Haste you made Sirrah, to bring me Word if <hi>Violante</hi> went home?</p>

<p>I can give you very good Reasons for my stay Sir.—Yes Sir, she went home.</p>

<p>O! Your Master knows that, for he has been there himself <hi>Lissardo.</hi></p>

<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Ha, <hi>Felix</hi> changes Colour at <hi>Lissardo</hi>'s News. What can it be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>A <hi>Scots</hi> Footman, that belongs to Colonel <hi>Britton,</hi> an Acquaintance of <hi>Frederick's</hi> say you; the Devil! If she be false, by Heaven I'll trace her. Prithy <hi>Frederick</hi> do you know one Colonel <hi>Britton</hi> a <hi>Scotsman?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Yes, why do you ask me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Nay no great Matter, but my Man tells me that he has had some little Difference with a Servant of his, that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>He is a good harmless innocent Fellow, I am
<pb n="61" facs="75"/>
sorry for it; the Colonel lodges in my House, I knew him formerly in <hi>England,</hi> and met him here by Accident last Night, and gave him an Invitation home, he is a Gentleman of a good Estate, besides his Commission; of excellent Principles, and strict Honour I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Is he a Man of Intrigue?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Like other Men I suppose, here he comes.—</p>
<stage>(<hi>Enter</hi> Colonel.</stage>
<p>Colonel, I began to think I had lost you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>—And not without some Reasons if you knew all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>There's no Danger of a fine Gentleman's being lost in this Town, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col,</speaker>
<p>That Compliment don't belong to me Sir. But I assure you I have been very near being run away with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Who attempted it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Faith I know her not—Only that she is a charming Woman, I mean as much as I saw of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>My Heart swells with Apprehension.—Some accidental Rencounter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>A Tavern I suppose adjusted the Matter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>A Tavern! No, no Sir, she is above that Rank I assure you, this Nymph sleeps in a Velvet Bed, and Lodgings every Way agreeable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Ha, a Velvet Bed!—I thought you said but now Sir, you knew her not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>No more I don't Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>How came you then so well acquainted with her Bed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, come, come, unfold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Why then you must know Gentleman, that I was convey'd to her Lodgings, by one of Cupids Emissaries, call'd a Chambermaid, in a Chair, thro' fifty blind Alleys, who by the help of a Key let me into a Garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="76"/>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>S'Death, a Garden, this must be <hi>Violante</hi>'s Garden. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>From thence conducted me into a spacious Room, then dropt me a Courtesie, told me her Lady would wait on me presently, so without unvailing modestly withdrew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Damn her Modesty; this was <hi>Flora.</hi><stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Well, how then Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Then Sir, immediately from another Door issued forth a Lady, arm'd at both Eyes, from whence such Showers of Darts fell round me, that had I not been cover'd with the Shield of another Beauty, I had infallibly fall'n a Martyr to her Charms; for you must know I just saw her Eyes, Eyes did I say? No, no, hold, I saw but one Eye, tho' I suppose it had a Fellow, equally as killing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>But how came you to see her Bed Sir? S'Death this Expectation gives a thousand Racks. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Why upon her Maid's giving Notice her Father was coming she thrust me into the Bed-Chamber.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Upon her Father's coming?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ay, so she said, but putting my Ear to the Keyhole of the Door, I found it was another Lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Confound the Jilt! 'Twas she without dispute. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Ah poor Colonel, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I discover'd they had had a Quarrel, but whether they were reconcil'd or not, I can't tell, for the second Alarm brought the Father in good earnest, and had like to have made the Gentleman and I acquainted, but she found some other Stratagem to convey him out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Contagion seize her, and make her Body ugly as her Soul. There's nothing left to doubt of now,—'Tis plain 'twas she,—Sure he knows me, and takes this Method to insult me, S'Death I cannot bear it. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>So when she had dispatch'd her old Lover, she
<pb n="63" facs="77"/>
paid you a Visit in her Bed-Chamber, ha, Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>No, Pox take the impertinent Puppy, he spoil'd my Diversion, I saw her no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Very fine! Give me Patience Heaven, or I shall burst with Rage. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>That was hard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Nay, what was worse, the Nymph that introduc'd me convey'd me out again over the Top of a high Wall, where I ran the Danger of having my Neck broke, for the Father it seems had lock'd the Door by which I enter'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>That Way I miss'd him:—Damn her Invention. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Pray Colonel was this the same Lady you met upon the <hi>Terrerio de passa</hi> this Morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Faith I can't tell Sir, I had a Design to know who that Lady was, but my Dog of a Footman, whom I had order'd to watch her home, fell fast a Sleep—I gave him a good beating for his Neglect, and I have never seen the Rascal since.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gib.</speaker>
<p>Troth de I Sir, and feel tee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>This must be a Mistake Colonel, for I know <hi>Violante</hi> perfectly well, and I'm certain she would not meet you upon the <hi>Terriero de passa.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Don't be too positive <hi>Frederick,</hi> now I have some Reasons to believe it was that very Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>You'd very much oblige me Sir, if you'd let me know these Reasons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I say I have a right to enquire into those Reasons you speak off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, really Sir I cannot conceive how you, or any Man can have a right to enquire into my Thoughts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Sir I have a Right to every Thing that relates to <hi>Violante</hi>—And he that traduces her Fame, and refuses to give his Reasons for't is a Villain.</p>
<stage>(<hi>Draws.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>What the Devil have I been doing; now Blisters on my Tongue, by Dozens. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Prithy <hi>Felix</hi> don't quarrel till you know for what, this is all a Mistake I'm positive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Look ye Sir, that I dare draw my Sword I think will admit of no Dispute.—But tho' fighting's my Trade, I'm not in Love with it, and think it more honourable to decline this Business, than pursue it. This may be a Mistake, however I'll give you my
<pb n="65" facs="79"/>
Honour never to have any Affair directly, or indirectly with <hi>Violante</hi> provided she is your <hi>Violante</hi>; but if there shou'd happen to be another of her Name I hope you wou'd not engross all the <hi>Violantes</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Your Vanity has given me sufficient Reasons to believe I'm not mistaken, I'm not to be impos'd upon Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Nor I bully'd Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Bully'd! S'Death, such another Word, and I'll nail thee to the Wall.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>So Quarrels spring up like Mushrooms, in a Minute: <hi>Violante,</hi> and he, was but just reconcil'd, and you have furnish'd him with fresh Matter for falling out again, and I am certain Colonel, <hi>Gibby</hi> is in the Wrong.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gib.</speaker>
<p>Gin I be Sir, the Mon that tald me leed, and gin he dud, the Deel be my Landlard, Hell my Winter Quarters, and a Rope my Winding Sheet, Gin I dee no lik him as lang as I can hold a Stick in my Hond, now see yee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for what I have said, for the Lady's Sake, but who could divine, that she was his Mistress, prithy who is this warm Spark?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>He is the Son of one of our Grandees, nam'd <hi>Don Lopez de Pementell,</hi> a very honest Gentleman, but something passionate in what relates to his Love.—He
<pb n="66" facs="80"/>
is an only Son, which perhaps may be one Reason for indulging his Passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>When Parents have but one Child, they either make a Madman, or a Fool of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>He is not the only Child, he has a Sister, but I think thro' the Severity of his Father, who would have married her against her Inclination, she has made her escape, and notwithstanding he has offer'd five hundred Pounds, he can get no Tydings of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ha! How long has she been missing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but since last Night, it seems.</p>

<p>I'm transported! This must be the Lady I caught; What sort of a Woman is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fred.</speaker>
<p>Middle siz'd, a lovely brown, a fine pouting Lip, Eyes that roul and languish, and seem to speak the exquisite Pleasure that her Arms could give!</p>

<p>Matchless Arrogance! True Sir, I should have kept Measures better with you, if the Conquest had been worth preserving, but we easily hazard what

gives us no Pain to loose.—As for my Eyes, you are mistaken if you think they have vanquished none but you; there are Men above your boasted Rank who have confess'd their Power, when their Misfortune in pleasing you made them obtain such a disgraceful Victory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Yes Madam, I am no Stranger to your Victories.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>And what you call the brightest Passage of my Life, is not the least glorious Part of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, don't put your self into a Passion, Madam, for I assure you after this Day I shall give you no Trouble.—You may meet your Sparks on the <hi>Terriero de Passa</hi> at Four in the Morning, without the least Regard of mine.—For when I quit your Chamber, the World shan't bring me back.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>I am so well pleas'd with your Resolution, I don't care how soon you take your leave.—But what you mean by the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi> at Four in the Morning I can't guess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, not you.—You was not upon the <hi>Terriero de passa</hi> at Four this Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>No, I was not; but if I was, I hope I may Walk where I please, and at what Hour I please without asking you leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Oh, doubtless Madam! And you might meet Colonel <hi>Britton</hi> there, and afterwards send your Emissary to fetch him to your House.—And upon your Father's coming in, thrust him into your Bed-Chamber—without asking my leave. 'Tis no Business of mine if you are exposed among all the Foot-Men in Town.—Nay, if they Ballad you, and cry you about at a half-Penny a piece.—They may without my Leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Audacious! Don't provoke me—Don't; my Reputation is not to be sported with <stage>(<hi>Going up to him.</hi>)</stage> at this rate.—No Sir, it is not. <stage>(<hi>bursts into Tears.</hi>)</stage> Inhuman <hi>Felix</hi>!—Oh <hi>Isabella,</hi> what a Train of Ills hast thou brought on me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Ha! I cannot bear to see her Weep.—A Woman's
<pb n="70" facs="84"/>
Tears are far more Fatal than our Swords. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Oh <hi>Violante.</hi>—S'Death! What a Dog am I? Now have I no Power to stir:—Dost not thou know such a Person as Colonel <hi>Britton?</hi> Prithy tell me, did'st not thou meet him at Four this Morning upon the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Were it not to clear my Fame, I would not answer thee thou black Ingrate!—But I cannot bear to be reproach'd with what I even Blush to think of, much less to act; by Heaven I have not seen the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi> this Day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Did not a <hi>Scots</hi> Foot-Man attack you in the Street neither <hi>Violante?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but he mistook me for another, or he was Drunk, I know not which.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>And do not you know this <hi>Scots</hi> Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vio.</speaker>
<p>Pray ask me no more Questions, this Night shall clear my Reputation, and leave you without Excuse for your base Suspicions; more than this I shall not satisfie you, therefore Pray leave me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Didst thou ever love me, <hi>Violante?</hi></p>

<p>Did ever Woman involve her self as I have done?</p>

<p>Now wou'd I give one of my Eyes to be Friends with her, for something whispers to my Soul she is not guilty.— <stage>(<hi>He pauses, then pulls a Chair, and sits by her at a little distance, looking at her some time without speaking—Then draws a little nearer to her.</hi>)</stage> Give me your Hand at parting however <hi>Violante,</hi> won't you, <stage>(<hi>Here he lays his open upon her Knee several times.</hi>)</stage> won't you—won't you—won't you?</p>

<p>They are, and I heartily ask the Colonel Pardon, and wish him Happy with my Sister; for Love has taught me to know, that every Man's Happiness consists in chusing for himself.</p>

<p>That's your Mistake, I prefer my Lady's Service, and turn you over to her that pleaded Right and Title to you to Day.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<head type="sub"><stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>SANTLOW.</hi></stage></head>
<byline><hi>Written by Mr.</hi> PHILIPS.</byline>
<l>CUstom with all our Modern Laws combin'd,</l>
<l>Has given such Power despotick to Mankind,</l>
<l>That We have only so much Vertue now,</l>
<l>As they are pleas'd in favour to allow.</l>
<l>Thus like Mechanick Work we're us'd with Scorn,</l>
<l>And wound up only, for a present Turn;</l>
<l>Some are for having our whole Sex enslav'd,</l>
<l>Affirming we've no Souls, and can't be sav'd;</l>
<l>But were the Women all of my Opinion,</l>
<l>We'd soon shake off this false usurp'd Dominion;</l>
<l>We'd make the Tyrants own, that we cou'd prove,</l>
<l>As fit for other Business as for Love.</l>
<l>Lord! What Prerogative might we obtain,</l>
<l>Could we from Yielding, a few Months refrain!</l>
<l>How fondly wou'd our starving Lovers doat!</l>
<l>What Homage wou'd be paid to Petticoat!</l>
<l>'Twou'd be a Jest to see the change of Fate,</l>
<l>How we might all of Politicks Debate;</l>
<l>Promise, and Swear, what we ne'er meant to do,</l>
<l>And what's still harder, <hi>keep your Secrets too.</hi></l>
<l>Ay Marry! <hi>Keep a Secret</hi> says a Beau,</l>
<l>And sneers at some ill-natur'd Wit below;</l>
<l>But Faith, if we shou'd tell but half we know,</l>
<l>There's many a spruce Young Fellow in this Place,</l>
<l>Would never more presume to show his Face;</l>
<l><hi>Women</hi> are not so weak, whate'er <hi>Men</hi> prate;</l>
<l>How many tip top Beau<hi>'s</hi> have had the Fate,</l>
<l>T'enjoy from <hi>Mamma</hi>'s Secrets their Estate.</l>
<l>Which if Her early Folly had made known,</l>
<l>He'd rid behind the Coach, that's now His own.</l>
<l>But here, the <hi>Wond'rous Secret</hi> you discover;</l>
<l>A <hi>Lady</hi> ventures for a <hi>Friend,</hi>—a <hi>Lover.</hi></l>
<l>Prodigious! For my part I frankly own,</l>
<l>I'd spoil'd the <hi>Wonder,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> shown.</l>
