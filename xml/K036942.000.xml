<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. SPARKS.</byline>
<sp>
<l>IN antient times, when <hi>Britain</hi>'s trade was arms,</l>
<l>And the lov'd musick of her youth, alarms.</l>
<l>A god-like race sustain'd fair <hi>England</hi>'s fame:</l>
<l>Who has not heard of gallant <hi>PIERCY</hi>'s name?</l>
<l>Ay, and of <hi>DOUGLAS?</hi> Such illustrious foes</l>
<l>In rival <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> never rose!</l>
<l>From age to age bright shone the <hi>British</hi> fire,</l>
<l>And every hero was a hero's sire.</l>
<l>When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,</l>
<l>Up sprung the Phoenix from his parent's tomb.</l>
<l>But whilst these generous rivals fought and fell,</l>
<l>These generous rivals lov'd each other well:</l>
<l>Tho' many a bloody field was lost and won,</l>
<l>Nothing in hate, in honour all was done.</l>
<l>When <hi>PIERCY</hi> wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers,</l>
<l>Fast came the <hi>DOUGLAS,</hi> with his <hi>Scottish</hi> spears;</l>
<l>And, when proud <hi>DOUGLAS</hi> made his King his foe,</l>
<l>For <hi>DOUGLAS, PIERCY</hi> bent his <hi>English</hi> bow.</l>
<l>Expell'd their native homes by adverse fate,</l>
<l>They knock'd alternate at each other's gate:</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>Then blaz'd the castle, at the midnight hour,</l>
<l>For him whose arms had shook its firmest tower.</l>
<l>This night a <hi>DOUGLAS</hi> your protection claims;</l>
<l>A wife! a mother! pity's softest names:</l>
<l>The story of her woes indulgent hear,</l>
<l>And grant your suppliant all she begs, a tear.</l>
<l>In confidence she begs; and hopes to find</l>
<l>Each <hi>English</hi> breast, like noble <hi>PIERCY</hi>'s kind.</l>

<head>SCENE I.</head>
<stage>The court of a castle, surrounded with woods.</stage>
<sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lady RANDOLPH.</stage>
<l>YE woods and wilds, whose melancholy gloom</l>
<l>Accords with my soul's sadness, and draws forth</l>
<l>The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,</l>
<l>Farewel a while: I will not leave you long;</l>
<l>For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,</l>
<l>Who from the chiding stream, or groaning oak,</l>
<l>Still hears, and answers to MATILDA's moan.</l>
<l>O DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! If departed ghosts</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="7"/>Are e'er permitted to review this world,</l>
<l>Within the circle of that wood thou art,</l>
<l>And with the passion of immortals hear'st</l>
<l>My lamentation: hear'st thy wretched wife</l>
<l>Weep for her husband slain, her infant lost.</l>
<l>My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn;</l>
<l>Who perish'd with thee on this fatal day.</l>
<l>To thee I lift my voice; to thee address</l>
<l>The plaint which mortal ear has never heard.</l>
<l>O disregard me not; though I am call'd</l>
<l>Another's now, my heart is wholly thine.</l>
<l>Incapable of change, affection lies</l>
<l>Buried, my DOUGLAS, in thy bloody grave.</l>
<l>But RANDOLPH comes, whom fate has made my Lord,</l>
<l>To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lord RANDOLPH.</stage>
<l>Again these weeds of woe! say, do'st thou well</l>
<l>To feed a passion which consumes thy life?</l>
<l>The living claim some duty; vainly thou</l>
<l>Bestow'st thy cares upon the silent dead.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Silent, alas! is he for whom I mourn:</l>
<l>Childless, without memorial of his name,</l>
<l>He only now in my remembrance lives.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Time, that wears out the trace of deepest anguish,</l>
<l>Has past o'er thee in vain. Wou'd thou wer't not</l>
<l>Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone!</l>
<l>Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM:</l>
<l>Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:</l>
<l>For when thy brother fell, he smil'd to hear</l>
<l>That DOUGLAS' son in the same field was slain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Oh! rake not up the ashes of my fathers:</l>
<l>Implacable resentment was their crime,</l>
<l>And grievous has the expiation been.</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="8"/>Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallant lives</l>
<l>Of either house were lost; my ancestors</l>
<l>Compell'd, at last, to leave their ancient seat</l>
<l>On Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of them</l>
<l>No heir is left. Had they not been so stern,</l>
<l>I had not been the last of all my race.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words.</l>
<l>I never ask'd of thee that ardent love,</l>
<l>Which in the breasts of fancy's children burns.</l>
<l>Decent affection, and complacent kindness</l>
<l>Were all I wish'd for; but I wish'd in vain.</l>
<l>Hence with the less regret my eyes behold</l>
<l>The storm of war that gathers o'er this land:</l>
<l>If I should perish by the Danish sword,</l>
<l>MATILDA would not shed one tear the more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Thou do'st not think so: woeful as I am</l>
<l>I love thy merit, and esteem thy virtues.</l>
<l>But whither goest thou now?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Straight to the camp,</l>
<l>Where every warrior on the tip-toe stands</l>
<l>Of expectation, and impatient asks</l>
<l>Each who arrives, if he is come to tell</l>
<l>The Danes are landed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>O, may adverse winds,</l>
<l>Far from the coast of Scotland, drive their fleet!</l>
<l>And every soldier of both hosts return</l>
<l>In peace and safety to his pleasant home!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Thou speak'st a woman's, hear a warrior's wish:</l>
<l>Right from their native land, the stormy north,</l>
<l>May the wind blow, till every keel is fix'd</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="9"/>Immoveable in Caledonia's strand!</l>
<l>Then shall our foes repent their bold invasion,</l>
<l>And roving armies shun the fatal shore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>War I detest: but war with foreign foes,</l>
<l>Whose manners, language, and whose looks are strange,</l>
<l>Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,</l>
<l>As that which with our neighbours oft we wage.</l>
<l>A river here, there an ideal line</l>
<l>By fancy drawn, divides the sister kingdoms.</l>
<l>On each side dwells a people similar,</l>
<l>As twins are to each other, valiant both,</l>
<l>Both for their valour famous thro' the world.</l>
<l>Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,</l>
<l>And, if they must have war, wage distant war,</l>
<l>But with each other fight in cruel conflict.</l>
<l>Gallant in strife, and noble in their ire,</l>
<l>The battle is their pastime. They go forth</l>
<l>Gay in the morning, as to summer sport:</l>
<l>When ev'ning comes, the glory of the morn,</l>
<l>The youthful warrior, is a clod of clay.</l>
<l>Thus fall the prime of either hapless land;</l>
<l>And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I'll hear no more: this melody would make</l>
<l>A soldier drop his sword, and doff his arms,</l>
<l>Sit down and weep the conquests he has made;</l>
<l>Yea, (like a monk), sing rest and peace in heav'n</l>
<l>To souls of warriours in his battles slain.</l>
<l>Lady, farewel: I leave thee not alone;</l>
<l>Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ANNA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Forgive the rashness of your ANNA's love:</l>
<l>Urg'd by affection, I have thus presum'd</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="10"/>To interrupt your solitary thoughts;</l>
<l>And warn you of the hours that you neglect,</l>
<l>And lose in sadness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>So to lose my hours</l>
<l>Is all the use I wish to make of time.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>To blame thee, lady, suits not with my state:</l>
<l>But sure I am, since death first prey'd on man,</l>
<l>Never did sister thus a brother mourn.</l>
<l>What had your sorrows been if you had lost,</l>
<l>In early youth, the husband of your heart?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Oh!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Have I distrest you with officious love,</l>
<l>And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate?</l>
<l>Forgive me, lady: humble tho' I am,</l>
<l>The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune:</l>
<l>So fervently I love you, that to dry</l>
<l>These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>What power directed thy unconscious tongue</l>
<l>To speak as thou hast done? to name —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>I know not:</l>
<l>But since my words have made my mistress tremble,</l>
<l>I will speak so no more; but silent mix</l>
<l>My tears with hers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>No, thou shalt not be silent.</l>
<l>I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt be</l>
<l>Henceforth th' instructed partner of my woes.</l>
<l>But what avails it? Can thy feeble pity</l>
<l>Roll back the flood of never-ebbing time?</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="11"/>Compell the earth and ocean to give up</l>
<l>Their dead alive?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>What means my noble mistress?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Didst thou not ask what had my sorrows been?—</l>
<l>If I in early youth had lost a husband? —</l>
<l>In the cold bosom of the earth is lodg'd,</l>
<l>Mangl'd with wounds, the husband of my youth;</l>
<l>And in some cavern of the ocean lyes</l>
<l>My child and his.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>O! lady, most rever'd!</l>
<l>The tale wrapt up in your amazing words</l>
<l>Deign to unfold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Alas! an ancient feud,</l>
<l>Hereditary evil, was the source</l>
<l>Of my misfortunes. Ruling fate decreed,</l>
<l>That my brave brother should in battle save</l>
<l>The life of DOUGLAS' son, our house's foe:</l>
<l>The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friendship.</l>
<l>To see the vaunted sister of his friend</l>
<l>Impatient, DOUGLAS to Balarmo came,</l>
<l>Under a borrow'd name.—My heart he gain'd;</l>
<l>Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd:</l>
<l>My brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage.</l>
<l>Three weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,</l>
<l>Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was call'd</l>
<l>To fight his father's battles; and with him,</l>
<l>In spite of all my tears, did MALCOLM go.</l>
<l>Scarce were they gone, when my stern sire was told</l>
<l>That the false stranger was lord DOUGLAS' son.</l>
<l>Frantic with rage, the baron drew his sword</l>
<l>And question'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,</l>
<l>Kneeling beneath his sword, fault'ring I took</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="12"/>An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would</l>
<l>Wed one of DOUGLAS name. Sincerity</l>
<l>Thou first of virtues, let no mortal leave</l>
<l>Thy onward path! altho' the earth should gape,</l>
<l>And from the gulf of hell destruction cry</l>
<l>To take dissimulation's winding way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! how few of woman's fearful kind</l>
<l>Durst own a truth so hardy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>The first truth</l>
<l>Is easiest to avow. This moral learn,</l>
<l>This precious moral, from my tragic tale.—</l>
<l>In a few days the dreadful tidings came</l>
<l>That DOUGLAS and my brother both were slain.</l>
<l>My lord! my life! my husband!—mighty God!</l>
<l>What had I done to merit such affliction?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>My dearest lady! Many a tale of tears</l>
<l>I've listen'd to; but never did I hear</l>
<l>A tale so sad as this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>In the first days</l>
<l>Of my distracting grief, I found myself—</l>
<l>As women wish to be who love their lords.</l>
<l>But who durst tell my father? The good priest</l>
<l>Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutour,</l>
<l>With his lov'd MALCOLM, in the battle fell:</l>
<l>They two alone were privy to the marriage.</l>
<l>On silence and concealment I resolv'd,</l>
<l>Till time should make my father's fortune mine.</l>
<l>That very night on which my son was born,</l>
<l>My nurse, the only confident I had,</l>
<l>Set out with him to reach her sister's house:</l>
<l>But nurse, nor infant, have I ever seen,</l>
<l>Or heard of, ANNA, since that fatal hour.</l>
<l>My murder'd child!—had thy fond mother fear'd</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="13"/>The loss of thee, she had loud fame defy'd,</l>
<l>Despis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,</l>
<l>And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning world.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Not seen, nor heard of! then perhaps he lives.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>No. It was dark December: wind and rain</l>
<l>Had beat all night. Across the Carron lay</l>
<l>The destin'd road; and in it's swelling flood</l>
<l>My faithful servant perish'd with my child.</l>
<l>O hapless son! of a most hapless sire!—</l>
<l>But they are both at rest; and I alone</l>
<l>Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,</l>
<l>Like a guilt-troubl'd ghost, my painful rounds:</l>
<l>Nor has despiteful fate permitted me</l>
<l>The comfort of a solitary sorrow.</l>
<l>Tho' dead to love, I was compell'd to wed</l>
<l>RANDOLPH, who snatch'd me from a villain's arms;</l>
<l>And RANDOLPH now possesses the domains,</l>
<l>That by Sir MALCOLM's death on me devolv'd;</l>
<l>Domains, that should to DOUGLAS' son have giv'n</l>
<l>A baron's title, and a baron's power.</l>
<l>Such were my foothing thoughts, while I bewail'd</l>
<l>The slaughter'd father of a son unborn.</l>
<l>And when that son came, like a ray from heav'n,</l>
<l>Which shines and disappears; alas! my child!</l>
<l>How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope</l>
<l>Of having thee, she knew not how, restor'd.</l>
<l>Year after year hath worn her hope away;</l>
<l>But left still undiminish'd her desire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>The hand, that spins th' uneven thread of life,</l>
<l>May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Not in this world: I have consider'd well</l>
<l>Its various evils, and on whom they fall.</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="14"/>Alas! how oft does goodness wound itself?</l>
<l>And sweet affection prove the spring of woe</l>
<l>O! had I died when my lov'd husband fell!</l>
<l>Had some good angel op'd to me the book</l>
<l>Of providence, and let me read my life,</l>
<l>My heart had broke, when I beheld the sum</l>
<l>Of ills, which one by one I have endur'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>That God, whose ministers good angels are,</l>
<l>Hath shut the book in mercy to mankind.</l>
<l>But we must leave this theme: GLENALVON comes:</l>
<l>I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,</l>
<l>And hitherwards he slowly stalks his way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I will avoid him. An ungracious person</l>
<l>Is doubly irksome in an hour like this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Why speaks my lady thus of RANDOLPH's heir?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Because he's not the heir of RANDOLPH's virtues.</l>
<l>Subtle and shrewd, he offers to mankind</l>
<l>An artificial image of himself:</l>
<l>And he with ease can vary to the taste</l>
<l>Of different men, it's features. Self-denied,</l>
<l>And master of his appetites he seems:</l>
<l>But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,</l>
<l>Watches to seize unseen the wish'd-for prey.</l>
<l>Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,</l>
<l>As in GLENALVON's unrelenting mind.</l>
<l>Yet is he brave and politic in war,</l>
<l>And stands aloft in these unruly times.</l>
<l>Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter;</l>
<l>Stay and detain him till I reach the castle.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>O happiness! where art thou to be found?</l>
<l>I see thou dwellest not with birth and beauty,</l>
<l>Tho' grac'd with grandeur, and in wealth array'd:</l>
<l>Nor dost thou, it would seem, with virtue dwell;</l>
<l>Else had this gentle lady miss'd thee not.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GLENALVON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GLENALVON.</speaker>
<l>What dost thou muse on, meditating maid?</l>
<l>Like some entranc'd and visionary seer</l>
<l>On earth thou stand'st, thy thoughts ascend to heaven.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Wou'd that I were, e'en as thou say'st, a seer,</l>
<l>To have my doubts by heav'nly vision clear'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLENALVON.</speaker>
<l>What dost thou doubt of? what hast thou to do</l>
<l>With subjects intricate? Thy youth, thy beauty,</l>
<l>Cannot be questioned: think of these good gifts;</l>
<l>And then thy contemplations will be pleasing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Let women view yon monument of woe,</l>

<l>So!—Lady RANDOLPH shuns me; by and by</l>
<l>I'll woo her as the lion wooes his brides.</l>
<l>The deed's a doing now, that makes me lord</l>
<l>Of these rich valleys, and a chief of power.</l>

<l>Will not be heard amidst the din of arms.</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="16"/>RANDOLPH has liv'd too long: his better fate</l>
<l>Had the ascendant once, and kept me down:</l>
<l>When I had seiz'd the dame, by chance he came,</l>
<l>Rescu'd and had the lady for his labour;</l>
<l>I 'scap'd unknown: a slender consolation!</l>
<l>Heaven is my witness that I do not love</l>
<l>To sow in peril, and let others reap</l>
<l>The jocund harvest. Yet I am not safe:</l>
<l>By love, or something like it, stung, inflam'd,</l>
<l>Madly I blabb'd my passion to his wife,</l>
<l>And she has threaten'd to acquaint him of it.</l>
<l>The way of woman's will I do not know:</l>
<l>But well I know the baron's wrath is deadly.</l>
<l>I will not live in fear: the man I dread</l>
<l>Is as a Dane to me; ay, and the man</l>
<l>Who stands betwixt me and my chief desire.</l>
<l>No bar but he; she has no kinsman near;</l>
<l>No brother in his sister's quarrel bold;</l>

<l>That it fares well, thanks to this gallant youth,</l>

<l>As down the winding dale I walk'd alone,</l>
<l>At the cross way four armed men attack'd me:</l>

<l><pb n="13" facs="18"/>Like my good angel in the hour of fate,</l>

<l>They turn'd upon him: but his active arm</l>

<l>The fiercest two; the others fled amain,</l>
<l>And left him master of the bloody field.</l>
<l>Speak, Lady RANDOLPH: upon Beauty's tongue</l>
<l>Dwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold.</l>
<l>Speak, noble dame, and thank him for thy lord.</l>

<l>My lord, I cannot speak what now I feel.</l>
<l>My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heav'n,</l>

<l>Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely brave</l>
<l>Fought on your side, against such fearful odds.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STRANGER.</speaker>
<l>A low born man, of parentage obscure,</l>
<l>Who nought can boast but his desire to be</l>
<l>A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Whoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobled</l>
<l>By the great King of Kings! thou art ordain'd</l>
<l>And stampt a hero by the sovereign hand</l>
<l>Of nature! blush not, flower of modesty</l>
<l>As well as valour, to declare thy birth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STRANGER.</speaker>
<l>My name is NORVAL: on the Grampian hills</l>
<l>My father feeds his flocks; a frugal swain,</l>
<l>Whose constant cares were to encrease his store,</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="19"/>And keep his only son, myself, at home.</l>
<l>For I had heard of battles, and I long'd</l>
<l>To follow to the field some warlike lord;</l>
<l>And heaven soon granted what my sire denied.</l>
<l>This moon which rose last night, round as my shield,</l>
<l>Had not yet fill'd her horns, when, by her light,</l>
<l>A band of fierce barbarians, from the hills,</l>
<l>Rush'd like a torrent down upon the vale,</l>
<l>Sweeping our flocks and herds. The shepherds fled</l>
<l>For safety, and for succour. I alone,</l>
<l>With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,</l>
<l>Hover'd about the enemy, and mark'd</l>
<l>The road he took, then hasted to my friends;</l>
<l>Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,</l>
<l>I met advancing. The pursuit I led,</l>
<l>Till we o'ertook the spoil-encumber'd foe.</l>
<l>We fought and conquer'd. E're a sword was drawn,</l>
<l>An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,</l>
<l>Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.</l>
<l>Returning home in triumph, I disdain'd</l>
<l>The shepherd's slothful life; and having heard</l>
<l>That our good king had summon'd his bold peers</l>
<l>To lead their warriours to the Carron side,</l>
<l>I left my father's house, and took with me</l>
<l>A chosen servant to conduct my steps:—</l>
<l>Yon trembling coward who forsook his master.</l>
<l>Journeying with this intent, I past these towers.</l>
<l>And, heaven-directed, came this day to do</l>
<l>The happy deed that gilds my humble name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>He is as wise as brave. Was ever tale</l>
<l>With such a gallant modesty rehears'd?</l>
<l>My brave deliverer! thou shalt enter now</l>
<l>A nobler list, and in a monarch's sight</l>
<l>Contend with princes for the prize of fame.</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="20"/>I will present thee to our Scottish king,</l>
<l>Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.</l>
<l>Ha! my MATILDA! wherefore starts that tear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I cannot say: for various affections,</l>
<l>And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;</l>
<l>Yet each of them may well command a tear.</l>
<l>I joy that thou art safe; and admire</l>
<l>Him and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety.</l>
<l>Obscure and friendless, he the army sought,</l>
<l>Bent upon peril, in the range of death</l>
<l>Resolv'd to hunt for fame, and with his sword</l>
<l>To gain distinction which his birth denied.</l>
<l>In this attempt unknown he might have perish'd,</l>
<l>And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.</l>
<l>Now grac'd by thee, his virtue serves no more</l>
<l>Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope</l>
<l>He stands conspicuous; fame and great renown</l>
<l>Are brought within the compass of his sword.</l>
<l>On this my mind reflected, whilst you spoke,</l>
<l>And bless'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!</l>
<l>My deeds shall follow where thou point'st the way.</l>
<l>Next to myself, and equal to GLENALVON,</l>
<l>In honour and command shall NORVAL be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>I know not how to thank you. Rude I am,</l>
<l>In speech and manners: never till this hour</l>
<l>Stood I in such a presence: yet, my lord,</l>
<l>There's something in my breast which makes me bold</l>
<l>To say, that NORVAL ne'er will shame thy favour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thou shalt be</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="21"/>My knight; and ever, as thou didst to-day,</l>
<l>With happy valour guard the life of RANDOLPH.</l>
</sp>

<l>We are thy debtors still; thy high desert</l>

<l>As was at first intended, to the camp.</l>
<l>Some of my train I see are speeding hither,</l>
<l>Impatient, doubtless, of their lord's delay.</l>
<l>Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes shall see</l>
<l>The chosen warriors of thy native land,</l>
<l>Who languish for the fight, and beat the air</l>
<l>With brandish'd swords.</l>

<l>Within these walls I rest; my tent I pitch</l>
<l>To-morrow in the field. Prepare the feast.</l>
<l>Free is his heart who for his country fights:</l>
<l>He in the eve of battle may resign</l>
<l>Himself to social pleasure; sweetest then,</l>

<l>How many years of anguish and despair</l>
<l>Has heav'n annex'd to those swift passing hours</l>
<l>Of love and fondness! Then my bosom's flame</l>
<l>Oft, as blown back by the rude breath of fear,</l>
<l>Return'd, and with redoubled ardour blaz'd.</l>

<l>One only cure can heav'n itself bestow;—</l>
<l>A grave—that bed in which the weary rest.</l>
<l>Wretch that I am! Alas! why am I so?</l>
<l>At every happy parent I repine!</l>
<l>How blest the mother of yon gallant NORVAL!</l>
<l>She for a living husband bore her pains,</l>
<l>And heard him bless her when a man was born:</l>
<l>She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breast;</l>
<l>Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:</l>
<l>She, with affection's triumph, saw the youth</l>
<l>In grace and comeliness surpass his peers:</l>
<l>Whilst I to a dead husband bore a son,</l>
<l>And to the roaring waters gave my child.</l>
</sp>

<l>Alas! alas! why will you thus resume</l>
<l>Your grief afresh? I thought that gallant youth</l>
<l>Would for a while have won you from your woe.</l>

<l>Delighted say'st thou? Oh! even there mine eye</l>

<l>I thought, that had the son of DOUGLAS liv'd,</l>
<l>He might have been like this young gallant stranger,</l>
<l>And pair'd with him in features and in shape,</l>
<l>In all endowments, as in years, I deem,</l>
<l>My boy with blooming NORVAL might have number'd.</l>
<l>Whilst thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fell</l>
<l>On my sad heart, and kindled up a fondness</l>
<l>For this young stranger, wand'ring from his home,</l>

<l>Which on such beggars freely is bestow'd:</l>
<l>For mortals know that love is still their lord,</l>

<speaker>PRISONER.</speaker>
<l>Then, thus adjur'd, I'll speak to you as just</l>
<l>As if you were the minister of heaven,</l>
<l>Sent down to search the secret sins of men.</l>
<l>Some eighteen years ago, I rented land</l>
<l>Of brave Sir MALCOLM, then BALARMO's lord;</l>
<l>But falling to decay, his servants seiz'd</l>
<l>All that I had, and then turn'd me and mine,</l>
<l>(Four helpless infants and their weeping mother)</l>
<l>Out to the mercy of the winter winds.</l>
<l>A little hovel by the river's side</l>
<l>Receiv'd us: there hard labour, and the skill</l>
<l>In fishing, which was formerly my sport,</l>
<l>Supported life. Whilst thus we poorly liv'd,</l>
<l>One stormy night, as I remember well,</l>
<l>The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:</l>
<l>Red came the river down, and loud and oft</l>
<l>The angry spirit of the water shrick'd.</l>
<l>At the dead hour of night was heard the cry</l>
<l>Of one in jeopardy. I rose, and ran</l>
<l>To where the circling eddy of a pool</l>
<l>Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within</l>
<l>My reach whatever floating thing the stream</l>
<l>Had caught. The voice was ceas'd; the person lost:</l>
<l>But looking sad and earnest on the waters,</l>
<l>By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,</l>
<l>A basket: soon I drew it to the bank,</l>
<l>And nestled curious there an infant lay.</l>
</sp>

<l>Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon</l>
<l>To do such deeds, as makes the prosperous men</l>
<l>Lift up their hands and wonder who could do them.</l>
<l>And such a man was I; a man declin'd,</l>
<l>Who saw no end of black adversity:</l>
<l>Yet, for the wealth of kingdoms, I would not</l>
<l>Have touch'd that infant, with a hand of harm.</l>

<sp>

<l>Permit me, ever honour'd! Keen impatience,</l>

<l>To the last hour that thou didst keep the child.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRISONER.</speaker>
<l>Fear not my faith, tho' I must speak my shame.</l>
<l>Within the cradle, where the infant lay,</l>
<l>Was stow'd a mighty store of gold and jewels;</l>
<l>Tempted by which we did resolve to hide,</l>
<l>From all the world, this wonderful event,</l>
<l>And like a peasant breed the noble child.</l>
<l>That none might mark the change of our estate,</l>
<l>We left the country, travell'd to the north,</l>
<l>Bought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forth</l>
<l>Our secret wealth, But God's all-seeing eye</l>
<l>Beheld our avarice, and smote us sore.</l>
<l>For one by one all our own children died,</l>
<l>And he, the stranger, sole remain'd the heir</l>
<l>Of what indeed was his. Fain then would I,</l>
<l>Who with a father's fondness lov'd the boy,</l>
<l>Have trusted him, now in the dawn of youth,</l>
<l>With his own secret: but my anxious wife,</l>
<l>Foreboding evil, never would consent.</l>
<l>Mean while the stripling grew in years and beauty;</l>
<l>And, as we oft observ'd, he bore himself,</l>
<l>Not as the offspring of our cottage blood;</l>
<l>For nature will break out: mild with the mild,</l>
<l>But with the froward he was fierce as fire,</l>
<l>And night and day he talk'd of war and arms.</l>
<l>I set myself against his warlike bent;</l>
<l>But all in vain: for when a desperate band</l>
<l>Of robbers from the savage mountains came —</l>

</sp>

<l>Sir MALCOLM's house deserv'd not; if aright</l>
<l>Thou told'st the story of thy own distress.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRISONER.</speaker>
<l>Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the flower;</l>
<l>The fastest friend, the best and kindest master.</l>
<l>But ah! he knew not of my sad estate.</l>
<l>After that battle, where his gallant son,</l>
<l>Your own brave brother, fell, the good old lord</l>
<l>Grew desperate and reckless of the world;</l>
<l>And never, as he erst was wont, went forth</l>
<l>To overlook the conduct of his servants.</l>
<l>By them I was thrust out, and them I blame:</l>
<l>May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my master!</l>
<l>And God so love me as I love his race!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>His race shall yet reward thee. On thy faith</l>
<l>Depends the fate of thy lov'd master's house.</l>
<l>Rememb'rest thou a little lonely hut,</l>
<l>That like a holy hermitage appears</l>

<l>The son of DOUGLAS, and Sir MALCOLM'S heir.</l>
<l>Remember well my words: if thou shouldst meet</l>
<l>Him whom thou call'st thy son, still call him so;</l>
<l>And mention nothing of his nobler father.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>PRISONER.</speaker>
<l>Fear not that I shall mar so fair an harvest,</l>
<l>By putting in my sickle 'ere 'tis ripe.</l>
<l>Why did I leave my home and ancient dame?</l>
<l>To find the youth, to tell him all I knew,</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GLENALVON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GLENALVON.</speaker>
<l>Noble dame!</l>
<l>The hov'ring Dane at last his men hath landed:</l>
<l>No band of pirates; but a mighty host,</l>
<l>That come to settle where their valour conquers;</l>
<l>To win a country, or to lose themselves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>But whence comes this intelligence, GLENALVON?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLENALVON.</speaker>
<l>A nimble courier sent from yonder camp,</l>
<l>To hasten up the chieftains of the north,</l>
<l>Inform'd me, as he past, that the fierce Dane</l>
<l>Had on the eastern coast of Lothian landed,</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="39"/>Near to that place where the sea-rock immense,</l>
<l>Amazing Bass looks o'er a fertile land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Then must this western army march to join</l>
<l>The warlike troops that guard Edena's tow'rs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLENALVON.</speaker>
<l>Beyond all question. If impairing time</l>
<l>Has not effac'd the image of a place,</l>
<l>Once perfect in my breast, there is a wild</l>
<l>Which lyes to westward of that mighty rock,</l>
<l>And seems by nature formed for the camp</l>
<l>Of water-wafted armies, whose chief strength</l>
<l>Lies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse:</l>
<l>If martial skill directs the Danish lords,</l>
<l>There inaccessible their army lies</l>
<l>To our swift scow'ring horse, the bloody field</l>
<l>Must man to man, and foot to foot, be fought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>How many mothers shall bewail their sons!</l>
<l>How many widows weep their husbands slain?</l>
<l>Ye dames of Denmark! ev'n for you I feel,</l>
<l>Who, sadly sitting on the sea-beat shore,</l>
<l>Long look for lords that never shall return.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Oft has th'unconquer'd Caledonian sword</l>
<l>Widow'd the north. The children of the slain</l>
<l>Come, as I hope, to meet their fathers' fate.</l>
<l>The monster war, with her infernal brood,</l>
<l>Loud yelling fury, and life-ending pain,</l>
<l>Are objects suited to GLENALVON's soul.</l>
<l>Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death;</l>
<l>Reproach, more piercing than the pointed sword.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I scorn thee not, but when I ought to scorn;</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="40"/>Nor e'er reproach, but when insulted virtue</l>

<l>I own thy worth, GLENALVON; none more apt</l>

<l>And be the echo of thy martial fame.</l>
<l>No longer vainly feed a guilty passion:</l>

<l>And let thy valour be the shield of RANDOLPH.</l>

<l>One instant stay, and hear an alter'd man.</l>

<l>I am your convert; time will shew how truely:</l>
<l>Yet one immediate proof I mean to give.</l>
<l>That youth for whom your ardent zeal to-day,</l>
<l>Somewhat too haughtily, defy'd your slave,</l>
<l>Amidst the shock of armies I'll defend,</l>
<l>And turn death from him, with a guardian arm.</l>
<l>Sedate by use, my bosom maddens not</l>
<l>At the tumultuous uproar of the field.</l>

<l>Whilst she and RANDOLPH live, and live in faith</l>
<l>And amity, uncertain is my tenure.</l>
<l>Fate o'er my head suspends disgrace and death,</l>
<l>By that weak hair, a peevish female's will.</l>
<l>I am not idle: but the ebbs and flows</l>
<l>Of fortune's tide cannot be calculated.</l>
<l>That slave of NORVAL's I have found most apt:</l>

<l>To say and swear whatever I suggest.</l>
<l>NORVAL, I'm told, has that alluring look,</l>
<l>'Twixt man and woman, which I have observ'd</l>
<l>To charm the nicer and fantastick dames,</l>
<l>Who are, like lady RANDOLPH, full of virtue.</l>
<l>In raising RANDOLPH's jealousy I may</l>

<l>Private I travel to the royal camp:</l>
<l>NORVAL, thou goest with me. But say young man!</l>
<l>Where didst thou learn so to discourse of war,</l>
<l>And in such terms, as I o'erheard to day?</l>
<l>War is no village science, nor it's phrase</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="44"/>A language taught amongst the shepherd swains.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>Small is the skill my lord delights to praise</l>
<l>In him he favours. — Hear from whence it came.</l>
<l>Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote</l>
<l>And inaccessible by shepherds trod,</l>
<l>In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,</l>
<l>A hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,</l>
<l>Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains.</l>
<l>Austere and lonely, cruel to himself,</l>
<l>Did they report him; the cold earth his bed,</l>
<l>Water his drink, his food the shepherd's alms.</l>
<l>I went to see him, and my heart was touch'd</l>
<l>With reverence and pity. Mild he spake,</l>
<l>And, entring on discourse, such stories told</l>
<l>As made me oft revisit his sad cell.</l>
<l>For he had been a soldier in his youth;</l>
<l>And fought in famous battles, when the peers</l>
<l>Of Europe, by the bold GODFREDO led,</l>
<l>Against th' usurping Infidel display'd</l>
<l>The cross of Christ, and won the Holy Land.</l>
<l>Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire</l>
<l>His speech struck from me, the old man wou'd shake</l>
<l>His years away, and act his young encounters:</l>
<l>Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd sit him down,</l>
<l>And all the live-long day discourse of war.</l>
<l>To help my fancy, in the smooth green turf</l>
<l>He cut the figures of the marshall'd hosts;</l>
<l>Describ'd the motions, and explain'd the use</l>
<l>Of the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,</l>
<l>The square, the crescent, and the phalanx firm.</l>
<l>For all that Saracen, or Christian knew</l>
<l>Of war's vast art, was to this hermit known.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Why did this soldier in a desart hide</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="45"/>Those qualities, that shou'd have grac'd a camp?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>That too at last I learn'd. Unhappy man!</l>
<l>Returning homewards by Messina's port,</l>
<l>Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,</l>
<l>A rude and boist'rous captain of the sea</l>
<l>Fasten'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought:</l>
<l>The stranger fell, and with his dying breath</l>
<l>Declar'd his name and lineage. Mighty God!</l>
<l>The soldier cried, my brother! Oh! my brother!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>His brother!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>Yes; of the same parents born;</l>
<l>His only brother. They exchang'd forgiveness:</l>
<l>And happy, in my mind, was he that died:</l>
<l>For many deaths has the survivor suffer'd.</l>
<l>In the wild desart on a rock he sits,</l>
<l>Or on some nameless stream's untrodden banks,</l>
<l>And ruminates all day his dreadful fate.</l>
<l>At times, alas! not in his perfect mind!</l>
<l>Holds dialogues with his lov'd brother's ghost;</l>
<l>And oft each night forsakes his sullen couch,</l>
<l>To make sad orisons for him he slew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>

<l>In this dire tragedy were there no more</l>

<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>If I were chain'd, unarm'd, and bedrid old,</l>
<l>Perhaps I should revile: But as I am</l>

<l>That to the castle leads. Whilst thus I rang'd,</l>
<l>I was alarm'd with unexpected sounds</l>
<l><pb n="58" facs="63"/>Of earnest voices. On the persons came:</l>
<l>Unseen I lurk'd, and overheard them name</l>
<l>Each other as they talk'd, lord RANDOLPH this,</l>
<l>And that GLENALVON: still of you they spoke,</l>
<l>And of the lady: threatning was their speech,</l>
<l>Tho' but imperfectly my ear could hear it.</l>
<l>'Twas strange, they said, a wonderful discov'ry;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NORVAL.</speaker>
<l>For being what you are;</l>
<l>Sir MALCOLM's heir: how else have you offended?</l>
<l>When they were gone, I hied me to my cottage,</l>
<l>And there sat musing how I best might find</l>
<l>Means to inform you of their wicked purpose.</l>
<l>But I could think of none: at last perplex'd</l>
<l>I issued forth, encompassing the tower</l>
<l>With many a weary step and wishful look.</l>

<l>Defend us gracious God! we are betray'd:</l>

<l>It must be so. That is the great discovery.</l>
<l>Sir MALCOLM's heir is come to claim his own;</l>
<l>And they will be reveng'd. Perhaps even now,</l>
<l>Arm'd and prepar'd for murder, they but wait</l>
<l>A darker and more silent hour, to break,</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="66"/>Into the chamber where they think thou sleep'st.</l>
<l>This moment, this, heav'n hath ordain'd to save thee!</l>
<l>Fly to the camp, my son!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOUGLAS.</speaker>
<l>And leave you here?</l>
<l>No: to the castle let us go together,</l>
<l>Call up the ancient servants of your house,</l>
<l>Who in their youth did eat your father's bread.</l>
<l>Then tell them loudly that I am your son.</l>
<l>If in the breasts of men one spark remains</l>
<l>Of sacred love, fidelity, or pity,</l>
<l>Some in your cause will arm. I ask but few</l>
<l>To drive those spoilers from my father's house.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>O nature, nature! what can check thy force?</l>
<l>Thou genuine offspring of the daring DOUGLAS!</l>
<l>But rush not on destruction: save thyself,</l>

<l>Thy stay but risks thy precious life in vain.</l>

<l>Which running eastward leads thee to the camp.</l>

<l>Which I by certain proof will soon confirm.</l>

<l>I yield me and obey: but yet my heart</l>
<l>Bleeds at this parting. Something bids me stay</l>

<l><pb n="62" facs="67"/>One thing I have to say before we part:</l>
<l>Long wert thou lost; and thou art found, my child,</l>

<l>Which way the current of thy temper sets:</l>
<l>To day I've found thee. Oh! my long lost hope!</l>
<l>If thou to giddy valour giv'st the rein,</l>
<l>To morrow I may lose my son for ever.</l>

<l>How will inglorious caution suit my claim?</l>

<l>O misery!</l>
<l>Amidst thy raging grief I must proclaim</l>

<l>Thy innocence!</l>

<speaker>Lady RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Of thee I think not: what have I to do</l>
<l>With thee, or any thing? My son! my son!</l>
<l>My beautiful! my brave! how proud was I</l>
<l>Of thee, and of thy valour! My fond heart</l>
<l>O'erflow'd this day with transport, when I thought</l>
<l>Of growing old amidst a race of thine,</l>
<l>Who might make up to me their father's childhood,</l>
<l>And bear my brother's and my husband's name:</l>
<l>Now all my hopes are dead! A little while</l>
<l>Was I a wife! a mother not so long!</l>
<l>What am I now? — I know. — But I shall be</l>
<l>That only whilst I please; for such a son</l>

<l>I fear thee not. I will not go.</l>
<l>Here I'll remain. I'm an accomplice, Lord,</l>
<l><pb n="68" facs="73"/>With thee in murder. Yes, my sins did help</l>
<l>To crush down to the ground this lovely plant.</l>
<l>O noblest youth that ever yet was born!</l>
<l>Sweetest and best, gentlest and bravest spirit,</l>
<l>That ever bless'd the world! Wretch that I am,</l>
<l>Who saw that noble spirit swell and rise</l>
<l>Above the narrow limits that confin'd it!</l>
<l>Yet never was by all thy virtues won</l>
<l>To do thee justice, and reveal the secret,</l>
<l>Which timely known, had rais'd thee far above</l>

<l>I know thee now: thy boldness I forgive:</l>

<l>Horror indeed!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>MATILDA?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>Is no more:</l>
<l>She ran, she flew like light'ning up the hill,</l>
<l>Nor halted till the precipice she gain'd,</l>
<l>Beneath whose low'ring top the river falls</l>
<l>Ingulph'd in rifted rocks: thither she came,</l>

<l>And headlong down. —</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>'Twas I! alas! 'twas I</l>
<l>That fill'd her breast with fury; drove her down</l>
<l>The precipice of death! Wretch that I am!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANNA.</speaker>
<l>O had you seen her last despairing look!</l>
<l>Upon the brink she stood, and cast her eyes</l>
<l>Down on the deep: then lifting up her head</l>
<l>And her white hands to heaven, seeming to say,</l>
<l>Why am I forc'd to this? She plung'd herself</l>
<l>Into the empty air.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RANDOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I will not vent,</l>
<l>In vain complaints, the passion of my soul.</l>
<l>Peace in this world I never can enjoy.</l>
<l>These wounds the gratitude of RANDOLPH gave.</l>
<l>They speak aloud, and with the voice of fate</l>
<l><pb n="70" facs="75"/>Denounce my doom. I am resolv'd. I'll go</l>
<l>Straight to the battle, where the man that makes</l>
<l>Me turn aside must threaten worse than death.</l>
<l>Thou, faithful to thy mistress, take this ring,</l>
<l>Full warrant of my power. Let every rite</l>
<l>With cost and pomp upon their funerals wait:</l>
<l>For RANDOLPH hopes he never shall return.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BARRY.</byline>
<sp>
<l>AN Epilogue I ask'd; but not one word</l>
<l>Our bard will write. He vows 'tis most absurd</l>
<l>With comick wit to contradict the strain</l>
<l>Of tragedy, and make your sorrows vain.</l>
<l>Sadly he says, that pity is the best,</l>
<l>And noblest passion of the human breast:</l>
<l>For when its sacred streams the heart o'er-flow,</l>
<l>In gushes pleasure with the tide of woe;</l>
<l>And when its waves retire, like those of <hi>Nile,</hi></l>
<l>They leave behind them such a golden soil,</l>
<l>That there the virtues without culture grow,</l>
<l>There the sweet blossoms of affection blow.</l>
<l>These were his words; void of delusive art</l>
<l>I felt them; for he spoke them from his heart.</l>
<l>Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,</l>
<l>To chace away celestial melancholy.</l>
