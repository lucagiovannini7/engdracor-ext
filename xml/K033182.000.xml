<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>THIS night with dread unusual we appear,</l>
<l>(For this has been a very damning year)</l>
<l>Establish'd fame perhaps in vain we bring,</l>
<l>Since rigid justice is an awful thing,</l>
<l n="5">Awful and hateful, human but in part,</l>
<l>All frown, an outside man, without a heart.</l>
<l>Such you may see in every street you pass,</l>
<l>Just as like men, in plaister, stone, or brass.</l>
<l>Our early Prologues in less cautious times,</l>
<l n="10">Rail'd at the audience in permitted rhymes,</l>
<l>Faults there might be, they own'd, but then wou'd swear,</l>
<l>Of faults or beauties, you no judges were.</l>
<l>As peers, by brother peers alone are tried,</l>
<l>Poets alone, on poets shou'd decide.</l>
<l n="15">With surly Ben this dogma first began,</l>
<l>So in succession to pert Colley ran.</l>
<l>John Dryden, with a crab stick of harsh wit,</l>
<l>Rejoiced to drub the Hydra of the pit.</l>
<l>Tho' little then was right, and much amiss,</l>
<l n="20">Not one of all the venom'd tongues durst hiss.</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>On the tamed spirit of the cudgel'd town,</l>
<l>Almanzor and mad Maximin went down.</l>
<l>Now, by inversion ten times more polite,</l>
<l>The poet's always wrong, the critic right.</l>
<l n="25">Nay, some have found a more enlighten'd way,</l>
<l>And boldly censure who ne'er saw the play.</l>
<l>This mayn't perhaps be justice to the letter,</l>
<l>To see is well, but inspiration's better.</l>
<l>Of old, the vehicles of wit were scarce,</l>
<l n="30">Men judged upon the spot of play or farce.</l>
<l>By no concocted spite the piece was torn,</l>
<l>The short lived Virus died where it was born.</l>
<l>No daily column then was gladly seen,</l>
<l>By envy raised, and scribled o'er by spleen.</l>
<l n="35">And sure if pleas'd or griev'd, we little gain,</l>
<l>By reasoning back the pleasure or the pain.</l>
<l>Still safely we may trust the feeling part,</l>
<l>But never set the head against the heart.</l>
<l>For various causes you frequent the scene,</l>
<l n="40">Some to dispel, but more to indulge the spleen.</l>
<l>Some fly a dun, and some a railing wise,</l>
<l>And lose the real, in fictitious life.</l>
<l>A passive mistress many here pursue,</l>
<l>But most we see have nothing else to do.</l>
<l n="45">Others prefer, the days dull business done,</l>
<l>To yawn in company than quite alone.</l>
<l><pb facs="4"/>Good harmless souls! may no rude sounds molest 'em</l>
<l>Nor passions, feign'd or real e'er infest 'em!</l>
<l>In times not long gone by, a noble peer,</l>
<l n="50">(Unlike the sprightly race who now trip here)</l>
<l>Four previous footmen his high state express,</l>
<l>And gorgeous as a satrap was his dress.</l>
<l>No household fowl on maple perch repos'd,</l>
<l>As innocent of thought, more sweetly dozed.</l>
<l n="55">Warm in his muff, with periwig for cap,</l>
<l>Here he indulged one discontinuous nap.</l>
<l>Yates, Woodward, Cibber, Garrick charm'd in vain,</l>
<l>Kind Morpheus held him in his softer chain.</l>
<l>Just as the curtain drop'd, he heard it said,</l>
<l n="60">A well known slentor of the stage was dead.</l>
<l>"I'm glad on't (cries my lord) and why do you think?</l>
<l>"He roar'd so loud, I cou'd not sleep one wink."</l>
<l>This night at times may kinder slumbers seize you,</l>
<l>Sleep when we're dull, and wake when we can please you.</l>
</div1>
<div1 type="prologue">

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>THO' he pretends no commerce with the skies,</l>
<l>A perfect stranger to deep mysteries,</l>
<l>Nor is astrologer enough to make</l>
<l>Predictions for a new year's Almanack,</l>
<l n="5">Yet for his play, the poet sees with sorrow,</l>
<l>And now foretells, what all may see to-morrow.</l>
<l>Tho' here, where genuine sense with candour reigns</l>
<l>Fair approbation crown his tragic strains,</l>
<l>(For oft this favour'd muse has been before you,</l>
<l n="10">Always to thank, but never to implore you)</l>
<l>A hundred sterner critics still remain,</l>
<l>To damn his labours, and your taste arraign.</l>
<l>In posts, gazettes, and chronicles they rage,</l>
<l>And failing to adorn, affright the stage.</l>
<l n="15">Turn to the usual column, there you'll see,</l>
<l>What those sage Delphic oracles decree.</l>
<l>First for the fable; "that's a flimzy tale,</l>
<l>"With unsupported characters, dull, stale,</l>
<l>"Not one generic, or original.</l>
<l n="20">"The situations want dramatic art,</l>
<l>"Such feeble patho's ne'er can touch the heart.</l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>"Next plainly does the plagiary appear,</l>
<l>"This, <hi>Ha!</hi> is Richard, and that <hi>Oh!</hi> is Lear,</l>
<l>The <hi>Pshaws,</hi> and <hi>Tuts</hi> are Shakspeare, Shakspeare clear.</l>
<l n="25">Yet why this rage to damn? the thief on shore </l>
<l>Who eyes the labouring bark, when tempests roar,</l>
<l>And prays, that rocks the vessel's ribs may break,</l>
<l>Means his own gain in plundering the wreck.</l>
<l>But tho' a thousand foundering poets split,</l>
<l n="30">None thrive, and some must lose by shipwreck'd wit.</l>
<l>Who steals your fame, as Shakspeare said of yore,</l>
<l>Enriches not himself but makes you poor.</l>
<l>The Tartar, when his comely foe lies slain,</l>
<l>Hopes with his spoils, his qualities to gain.</l>
<l n="35">Cou'd critics every excellence destroy,</l>
<l>They nought inherit, but the barbarous joy.</l>
<l>Then of all censors, none are so severe</l>
<l>As those, whose scenes have been exploded here.</l>
<l>Self rais'd to the tribunal seat of letters,</l>
<l n="40">As rogues made justices, they try their betters.</l>
<l>Unlike the Carthage queen, the ills they bore</l>
<l>But indurate their callous bosoms more.</l>
<l>Shou'd some pert teacher, his own worth to enhance</l>
<l>Decry all rival brothers of the dance,</l>
<l n="45">Swear, one was aukward, t'other's manner coarse,</l>
<l>Another hobbled like a founder'd horse,</l>
<l>Say wou'd you not the envious railer blame,</l>
<l>When once you knew, Coupee himself was lame?</l>
<l><pb facs="7"/>Some merry idlers to the pen resort,</l>
<l n="50">And free from malice, write at us in sport,</l>
<l>Like the poor pelted frogs we cry out thus,</l>
<l>"Alas 'tis play to you, but death to us."</l>
<l>Yet shou'd some genuine critic point a fault,</l>
<l>Our author's not too forward to be taught,</l>
<l n="55">To sage good counsel thankful he'll attend,</l>
<l>And think who spares him least, is most his friend.</l>

<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>THOU dost but mock me. Must I hear for ever</l>
<l>How great thy preparations, while I know</l>
<l>How poor the deeds that follow. What avails it</l>
<l>That thy deep practices with Lentulus</l>
<l>Inflamed his ardor; that the fuel's laid</l>
<l>To wrap the towering capitol in fire;</l>
<l>(The appointed signal to begin the assault</l>
<l>On the unguarded Titus) that our friends</l>
<l>On the right arm display a Tyrian scarf,</l>
<l n="10">Amidst the blaze and tumult to distinguish </l>
<l>The abettors of our boldness,—this dull tale</l>
<l>With nauseous iteration ten times boasted</l>
<l>Indignant I have heard. Still my revenge</l>
<l>Preys on itself, the tyrant lives to scorn me,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="10"/>Lives to usurp a throne by right Vitellia's,</l>
<l>Nay worse, to brave me by a public act</l>
<l>That gives my sceptre, and his worthless hand</l>
<l>To Syrian Berenice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Worthless hand!</l>
<l>Then wherefore anxious how he give that hand?</l>
<l>Why shou'd you wish it offer'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l n="20">To reject it.</l>
<l>What can I plead for thee? My own just rage</l>
<l>That burns unceasing in this boiling breast,</l>
<l>At times seems heighten'd by thy fiercer flame.</l>
<l>What will not Sextus dare at parting from me;</l>
<l>Allegiance, danger, friendship, melt before me.</l>
<l>But when I fly with ready recompence,</l>
<l>I find the promis'd service unperform'd,</l>
<l>Some haggar'd fear arrests thy trembling arm,</l>
<l>Phantoms, and doubts, and conscience shiver thee.</l>
<l n="30">How can I reconcile such contraries,</l>
<l>Such ardor with such coldness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I as well</l>
<l>Might bid the rapid whirlwind give me audience,</l>
<l>For while intemperate choler—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Now I'm calm,</l>
<l>Now to thy casuistry—if words have power</l>
<l>To reconcile a lover's faith and honour</l>
<l>With expectations, rais'd but to be crush'd,</l>
<l>With oaths dissolv'd, even like the breath that form'd them,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="11"/>Thou art a rhetorician subtler far</l>
<l>Than he of Greece, or our own smooth-tongued Tully.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I know no art, nor does this cause require it.</l>
<l n="41">If 'tis a crime to be irresolute,</l>
<l>Where duty, honour, gratitude combine</l>
<l>To bid me not resolve; I own the charge,</l>
<l>Nay ought (whate'er the forfeit) glory in it.</l>
<l>Cou'd I at once determine on this deed,</l>
<l>Did no compunctious harrowings within</l>
<l>Print deep the prohibition on my soul:</l>
<l>I were a monster, madam, not a Roman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>A Roman! no, give o'er that empty boast;</l>
<l>Shame of the unworthy.—Oaths are bonds with Romans,</l>
<l n="51">Even at the altar of eternal Truth,</l>
<l>The holy fane clasp'd by thy outstretch'd arms</l>
<l>I bound thee by such sacred ceremonies,</l>
<l>(When first I listen'd to thy well-feign'd passion)</l>
<l>Ne'er to divulge what to thy faith I trusted,</l>
<l>And next, tho' Stygian horrors compass'd it</l>
<l>To join my vengeance; now to hear this sound,</l>
<l>This windy vaunt "that Sextus is a Roman."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Whatever be my country, or my nature,</l>
<l n="60">One character I wear indelible,</l>
<l>Thy fond, thy faithful lover. Oh Vitellia!</l>
<l>The wavering of my soul too strongly proves</l>
<l>How fierce the storm that shakes me. Yet alas!</l>
<l>Like the tall pine when Caurus takes his top,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="12"/>While the sharp axe indents his trunk beneath,</l>
<l>I struggle, but to fall. Say is it little,</l>
<l>I can even think to perpetrate a crime</l>
<l>To late posterity must damn my fame,</l>
<l>Blanch the dark records of past villainy,</l>
<l n="70">And make the name of Caesar's treacherous friend </l>
<l>Stand single in th' abhor'd pre-eminence!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Then be the friend of Caesar, from this hour</l>
<l>No more Vitellia's lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Ever, ever.</l>
<l>My fruitless turmoil in the fatal snare</l>
<l>But winds it closer round me. Urged by thee</l>
<l>Treason seems justice, dark assassination</l>
<l>Wears the bright robe of honourable vengeance.</l>
<l>I know the infatuation of my soul,</l>
<l>There is no crime of deepest ebon dye</l>
<l n="80">My prompt obedience would not perpetrate.</l>
<l>By thee arraign'd this gracious emperor</l>
<l>Seems to deserve the bloodiest tyrant's doom,</l>
<l>But oh when I approach his matchless virtues,</l>
<l>My fury turns to reverence, awe, and wonder.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Brave when the danger's distant—what more common?</l>
<l>The courage of our peasants.—But go on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Unjust Vitellia! think ere you condemn</l>
<l>A heart so torn as mine—you steel my arm</l>
<l>To wreak your dire revenge, the emperor</l>
<l n="90"><pb n="5" facs="13"/>Demands my loyalty. Thy offer'd hand </l>
<l>Impels on one side, every tye of honour</l>
<l>Binds me to Titus. All my love, is thine,</l>
<l>My duty, his. To thee when I return,</l>
<l>Some new discover'd beauty fires my sense,</l>
<l>While in the soul of Titus I admire</l>
<l>Some freshly blooming virtue. Scorned by thee</l>
<l>Life were a burden, yet to pay this price</l>
<l>Seals me a wretch for ever. Powers of justice!</l>
<l>Can she hear this, and yet reproach her Sextus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l n="100">Assure thyself of no reproach from me.</l>
<l>Scorn and contempt are silent monitors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Yet think ere one irrevocable stroke</l>
<l>Deprive the world of its first ornament,</l>
<l>Rome of a father, Nature of a friend.</l>
<l>Revolve the heroic spirits of times past,</l>
<l>See him unparallel'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>He has some virtues,</l>
<l>But men like monsters only are without them.</l>
<l>Nero reign'd five years wisely.—But my father!</l>
<l>Was there an insult to sink degradation</l>
<l n="110">From Pride's high pinnacle to ignominy,</l>
<l>Unpractised on their emperor? Hooted, drag'd,</l>
<l>(The dagger at his throat) by dungeon slaves</l>
<l>O'er their polluted pavements. O just Ate</l>
<l>Appease his manes with luxuriant slaughter!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>What justice can involve him in the charge?</l>
<l>He not contrived, nor countenanced the outrage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>No, but he profits by it. That condemns him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I know him form'd with every excellence,</l>
<l>Brave, pious, merciful, benevolent.</l>
<l n="120">Would he reward desert, his coffers seem </l>
<l>Poor to his boundless liberality.</l>
<l>Is he constrain'd to punish, his sweet nature</l>
<l>Finds some soft palliative for every wretch,</l>
<l>Green inexperience pleads the excuse for one,</l>
<l>Grey hairs absolves another. Every day</l>
<l>That passes o'er his head unmark'd by bounty</l>
<l>He calls a blank in life, and strikes it off</l>
<l>As worthless to be number'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Grant it all.</l>
<l>Yet still he reigns.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>He reigns 'tis true, Vitellia!</l>
<l n="130">But all the cares of royalty are his,</l>
<l>And all the blessings ours—the laurel wreath,</l>
<l>The Imperial purple.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Hear, majestic Juno!</l>
<l>And dost thou come with pomp of sounding words</l>
<l>The herald of my foe, to trumpet forth</l>
<l>His irksome virtues? sure thou hast forgot</l>
<l>This boasted pageant wears the diadem</l>
<l>His father tore from mine. Say shou'd he not,</l>
<l>(Had he a monarch's sense of royal justice)</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="15"/>Have shar'd that diadem his father ravish'd</l>
<l>With her who rightly own'd it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l n="140">Ah Vitellia!</l>
<l>Is this the proof of hate? the vizor falls,</l>
<l>In vain its outside varnish wou'd display</l>
<l>The father's wrongs, the daughter's piety,</l>
<l>Reveal'd beneath the genuine face displays</l>
<l>The burning flush of angry jealousy.—</l>

<l>And must this desperate hand.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>I'll hear no more.</l>
<l>Here I absolve thee from thy worthless vows,</l>
<l>Thus give them to the winds. Soon shall I find</l>
<l n="150">A braver arm to vindicate my cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I cannot bear these frowns.</l>

<l>The senate, Rome!</l>
<l>It is a kind of mockery to name them.</l>
<l>Did they not flatter Nero? Half the crimes</l>
<l>Of their mad emperors, Rome's slaves engender'd.</l>
<l>Her infancy was savage and unjust,</l>
<l>Polish'd depravity her riper age,</l>
<l>With every new refinement, some new guilt,</l>
<l>Even in her sports and pleasures barbarous.</l>
<l>But now, her rank maturity arrived,</l>
<l n="180"><pb n="9" facs="17"/>She soaks and fattens in gross infamy.</l>
<l>If there were any righteous Jupiter,</l>
<l>His thunder would proclaim him. This vile city,</l>
<l>This stew of sordid vice and luxury,</l>
<l>Upturn'd from its foundations, rent and crush'd</l>
<l>Would smoke in frightful piles, a monument</l>
<l>That there were gods, and Rome provok'd their vengeance.</l>

<l>To turn the destin'd slaughter on themselves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>O righteous doom of black conspiracy,</l>
<l>Always abhor'd, and rarely fortunate.</l>
<l>The blood that issues from a monarch's wound</l>
<l>Ensanguines deep the sword which dares to shed it.</l>

<l>By the same steel and dying to prophane</l>

<l>Disgracing the proud pomp they howling follow.</l>
<l>Where were these thoughts when thy young ardour found me</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l n="280">Oh the more villain I, and every tongue </l>

<l>When the world's wonder, Sion's haughty Temple,</l>

<l>To rule the province, I had help'd to conquer,</l>
<l>He durst deny me—what the reason think you?</l>
<l>Because those outcasts of the peopled world,</l>
<l n="300">The scum and scorn of nations, Jews, vile Jews,</l>
<l>Accused me of extortion in his absence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Was that the cause? O god-like emperor!</l>
<l>How shall the breath of friendship raise thy name,</l>

<l>O FATHER of thy country! thus the senate</l>

<l>Hear me ye Romans! to deserve your love</l>
<l>Is the first wish that animates my breast,</l>
<l>Let not that love exceed its modest bounds</l>
<l>To stain the emperor's cheek and yours with blushes.</l>
<l>How wou'd the eternal movers of the world</l>

<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Ah Sir! I dread to speak—your Berenice.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Oh spare me, spare me. 'Twas a painful struggle.</l>
<l>Rome and the emperor saw with different eyes,</l>
<l>Rome, that she was a stranger and a queen,</l>
<l>And I, her truth and beauty.</l>

<l>The chambers next to these were once the queen's,</l>
<l>Nor eye nor foot but mine shall visit them</l>
<l>Since she forsakes them. There I'll give my soul</l>
<l>Its burst of anguish, there I'll hear her voice,</l>
<l>There her enchanting form shall smile before me</l>
<l n="70">In all her soft luxuriancy of beauty.</l>
<l>The lute she touch'd, the flowers her needle painted</l>
<l>Now mute or scatter'd as she cast them from her,</l>
<l>Remind me of the dear delicious hours</l>
<l>When my enamour'd heart spoke out, and own'd her.</l>
<l>Thy master there will be no emperor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Yet in the senate be an emperor.</l>
<l>The name of queen we know is alien to them,</l>
<l>(Such is the force of rooted prejudice,)</l>
<l>Tho' in the imperial title they endure</l>
<l n="80">More subjugation than Rome's seven kings,</l>
<l>Had all been Tarquins, cou'd impose upon them,</l>
<l>They tremble at the shade, but hug the substance.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>I rule their will, but can't remove their error.</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="28"/>Fatal to my repose, or shade or substance.</l>
<l>A prey to cankerous regret within,</l>
<l>I strive against the feeling which consumes me,</l>
<l>My reason disesteems my heart's desire,</l>
<l>Condemns the choice, and yet adores the object.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Such clamorous prayers are impiety.</l>
<l>They do instruct the gods, and not adore them.</l>
<l>There is more worship in one contrite sigh</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I did it not. Struck with remorse too late</l>
<l n="110">I strove to save him. Ere I could arrive </l>
<l>A villain of the vile confederacy</l>
<l>Had pierced him from behind. In vain I cried,</l>
<l>"Hold monster! hold!" the fatal blow was sped,</l>
<l>The assassin left his execrable steel</l>
<l>Deep in the wound, and fled. In haste I tried</l>
<l>To wrench it forth, but with the reeking blade</l>
<l>The blood gush'd on my robe, and oh dire fate!</l>
<l>The hero closed his eyes, and lifeless fell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Why am not I too dead! Oh tis too much!</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="47"/>Had the same hour that snatch'd his precious life</l>
<l n="120">Seal'd these sad eyes in everlasting night,</l>
<l>Had the same stroke transfix'd this throbbing heart,</l>
<l>How had I bless'd the hour, how clasp'd the wound</l>
<l>What endless misery had this breast escaped.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Pity and rage impell'd me to chastise</l>
<l>The impious murderer. In vain I sought him</l>
<l>He has escaped my fury. Fiends shall find him,</l>
<l>No darkness can conceal it. But oh Princess!</l>
<l>What shades will cover Sextus! Earth nor heaven</l>
<l>Will shelter or receive me. Where's my peace?</l>
<l n="130">See what a price my desperate passion pays </l>
<l>To satisfy thy fury.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>True, too true.</l>
<l>I am a monster. This inhuman breast</l>
<l>Might suckle tigers, give to savage natures</l>
<l>More deadly fierceness. Blood-stain'd as thou art</l>
<l>Thy soul is white as Alpine snow compared</l>
<l>With my deep guilt. From this detested hour,</l>
<l>Mankind, like withering pestilence will shun me.</l>
<l>I am the curse which yon mysterious heaven</l>
<l>Hangs o'er thy destin'd towers, imperial Rome!</l>
<l n="140">Thy sun is set, let darkness veil the earth,</l>
<l>Portentous, terrible; the offended Gods</l>
<l>Tho' hoary Flamens choke their skies with incense,</l>
<l>Ne'er cast one look to this devoted land</l>
<l>Abandoned o'er to man's enormity,</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="48"/>This land of horror, guilt, and parricide.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Oh thou had'st wrongs to mitigate thy crime,</l>
<l>But what had I? I lost no throne by Titus,</l>
<l>Tho' thousands sought, and merited his favour,</l>
<l>Still on my head the precious dew was shower'd.</l>
<l n="150">Honour and wealth thro' all the mighty empire,</l>
<l>In copious streams flow'd from the will of Sextus.</l>
<l>Cherish'd, beloved! and well have I repaid him.</l>
<l>No father's shade like thine, cou'd haunt my slumbers,</l>
<l>To punish in the son, the sire's offence.</l>
<l>Yet villain I contrived—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>A father's shade!</l>
<l>Oh speak no more—Can base hypocrisy,</l>
<l>Affected reverence for a father's wrongs</l>
<l>Wash out the stains that purple all my soul?</l>
<l n="160">A father's wrongs! a fury's jealousy.</l>
<l>Revenge devised the tale, and hell confirm'd it.</l>
<l>I felt no touch of filial piety.</l>
<l>Deluded man! now be thy anger just.</l>
<l>Why gleams that dagger idly in thy hand?</l>
<l>It reeks with precious blood. Here turn the point.</l>
<l>One drop from that dear stream mix'd in my veins</l>
<l>At least will rise, and plead in Heaven to spare me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Wou'dst thou then doubly dye my hands in murder,</l>
<l>To wash out blood, by blood? Unhappy princess!</l>
<l n="170">'Twere blessedness to die. The righteous gods </l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="49"/>Reserve us both for heavier punishment.</l>
<l>Fruitless remorse, and ever gnawing anguish</l>
<l>We must endure while mortal, and hereafter,</l>
<l>All hell will rouse to wake new torments for us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Give me my just pre-eminence in woe.</l>
<l>Can friendship mourn like love. Too long I feign'd,</l>
<l>Struggled too long to hide the secret from thee</l>
<l>Deceived thee most, when most I seem'd to hate him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well, 'tis well! let me feel all my horror.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>The first strong passion of my soul was love,</l>
<l n="180">Its first dear object, Titus. Burst poor bosom!</l>
<l>All my fond heart could wish, my fancy form</l>
<l>Was heaven contriving for me. At the moment</l>
<l>My fatal frenzy urged thee to the deed</l>
<l>I was proclaim'd his empress. This curs'd day</l>
<l>Had seal'd him mine. Be merciful, and kill me,</l>
<l>Take pity on me heaven! it chokes devours me.</l>
<l>'Tis insupportable. O Titus! Titus!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Is this the balm thou pour'st into my wounds,</l>
<l>First raise the assassin's arm, and then despise him?</l>
<l n="190">Tho' all the world should cast me forth with scorn,</l>
<l>Abhor, pursue me, thou shou'dst stretch thy hand</l>
<l>And pour the balm of comfort o'er my anguish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>What balm, what comfort can Vitellia give thee?</l>
<l>Ask it from roaring seas, or burning Aetna,</l>
<l>Their rage is calm as slumb'ring infancy</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="50"/>To the wild passion of this stormy breast.</l>
<l>These hornet sounds already buzz around me,</l>
<l>"An emperor might be spared, but not a Titus.</l>
<l>"The land just panting with recover'd breath,</l>
<l>"Raw from the lash of gory tyranny.</l>
<l>"A balmy prince healing and merciful,</l>
<l>"Snatch'd from the bliss of sweet benevolence,</l>
<l n="200">"To satiate an Alecto's jealous fury."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>'Twas fear, 'twas phantom when I urged his virtues.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vitellia.</speaker>
<l>Oh let us meet no more. Each time I view thee,</l>
<l>Again I seem to urge, he bleeds again.</l>
<l>Thou wert too quick, too ready to obey me.</l>
<l>Wou'd I had found some dilatory slave,</l>
<l>Insensible and cold. He wou'd have sooth'd,</l>
<l>Promis'd, but not perform'd, saved me from crimes</l>
<l>Heaven's mercy can't absolve, nor hell can punish.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Vitellia rushes out.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS</speaker>
<stage>alone.</stage>
<l>All is accomplish'd. I have pass'd the brink</l>
<l n="210">Of every hope and fear. Does ought remain?</l>
<l>Is there a friend to trust, and be betray'd?</l>
<l>A mistress to impel my hand to murder,</l>
<l>And then disclaim, revile me, and avoid.</l>
<l>Ye thoughts that drive my whirling brain to madness,</l>
<l>Ye vengeful furies that besiege my soul,</l>
<l><pb n="43" facs="51"/>I will not wait your tardy ministry,</l>
<l>But leap the gulph, and plunge at once to darkness.</l>

<sp>

<l n="221">No, those bright portals are for ever bar'd.</l>
<l>There throned with demi-gods the hero sits,</l>
<l>Nor bends his glorious eyes to earth and me.</l>
<l>But I am doom'd to tread the dreary realms</l>

<l>Where Phlegeton boils o'er with livid fires,</l>
<l>Where guilty ghosts shall hiss me from their haunts,</l>
<l>And yelling furies through the gloom pursue me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l n="230">Thy reason is disturb'd. Rouse, rouse for shame,</l>
<l>Decline not thus thy drooping brow to earth.</l>
<l>Why roll thy wandering eyes on vacant air</l>
<l>Shaping a hideous host of threat'ning forms,</l>
<l>From the black coinage of distemper'd fancy?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Think'st thou, these horrors are fantastical?</l>
<l>I feel them here; here is substantial hell,</l>
<l>Here, ever whirling wheels, and gnawing vultures.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Striking his breast.</stage>
<sp>

<l>Come banish in the emperor's embrace</l>
<l><pb n="44" facs="52"/>This gloomy brood of thick-eyed melancholy.</l>
<l n="240">Now while the busy throng surround his throne,</l>
<l>When even Indifference wears the face of zeal,</l>
<l>And feels, or feigns officious loyalty,</l>
<l>He wonders much thou art not by his side,</l>
<l>That thou cou'dst leave him in the hour of peril.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>That I cou'd leave him! how, is he not slain!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Forbid it heaven! No, he returns unhurt,</l>
<l>Safe from the wild commotion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Can it be!</l>
<l>Are my eyes false? Sure I beheld him fall,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Where beheld him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>In the frequented pass that leads from hence</l>
<l n="251">To the Flaminian.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Then thy eyes deceived thee.</l>
<l>Some other in the throng and wild confusion</l>
<l>Thy sight mistook for Titus.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>How some other?</l>
<l>Say who cou'd dare to assume the imperial robe,</l>
<l>The sacred laurel, and the sovereign ensigns</l>
<l>Worn by the emperor only?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Nay I know not.</l>
<l>But Titus lives (praise to kind heaven) unhurt.</l>
<l>I left him but this moment, and to seek thee.</l>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Yes I. 'Twas I betray'd him.</l>
<l>I, the prime mover of the foul sedition,</l>

<l>I am lost in wonder.</l>
<l>Thou Sextus, thou betray the emperor!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Ask me no more. Spare the reiteration.</l>
<l>One fatal moment Annius has undone me.</l>
<l>Farewell! a long, a last adieu to Rome.</l>
<l n="280">Think sometimes of thy friend, not what he is,</l>
<l>But what he was; and if his crimes will rise</l>
<l>To blot the kind remembrance, oh forget not,</l>

<l>How sharp his sufferings, how sincere his sorrow.</l>

<l>This is indeed a dreadful cause for sorrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>Ay is it not, for never ceasing sorrow?</l>
<l>Farewell once more. I go for ever from thee</l>
<l>To mourn, and hide my guilt in solitude.</l>
<l>To fall by my own hand were cowardice.</l>
<l n="290">May every God who sees my deep remorse </l>
<l>Guard him, whom I no more must dare to name.</l>
<l>Thou Annius! with thy courage and thy faith,</l>
<l>'Gainst foreign danger, and domestic treason,</l>
<l>By day, by night, in peace, in war, defend him,</l>
<l>Defend him from the inconstancy of Rome,</l>
<l>But most defend him from his treacherous friends.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Another time explain this mystery,</l>
<l>Now let me think. The plot is yet unknown.</l>
<l>The flames 'tis thought were spread by accident,</l>
<l n="300">But thy precipitate flight, unhappy friend!</l>
<l>Will six on thee the stain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>What canst thou counsel?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Do not withdraw, but keep the secret close.</l>
<l>Attend the emperor—think all pass'd a dream,</l>
<l>When dusky spirits ruled the unwholesome air,</l>
<l>And from their vaprous pinions dipt in Styx,</l>
<l>Shook phantoms round thy head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>The wounded wretch</l>
<l><pb n="47" facs="55"/>(Whoe'er he was) that fell beneath the stroke</l>
<l>Ere this perhaps has given me up to shame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>I'll to the place where you beheld him fall,</l>
<l n="310">Examine who he was, and bring thee tidings </l>
<l>Of all that may concern thy life or safety.</l>
<l>Before the breast of Titus can admit</l>
<l>Suspicion of thy faith, there will be time</l>
<l>To apprise thee of the danger. Then withdraw,</l>
<l>Uncertain is the peril if you stay,</l>
<l>But certain, if you fly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>My scatter'd sense</l>
<l>Scarce comprehends thy reason, tho' my heart</l>
<l>Acknowledges the kindness. Guide me Annius!</l>
<l>I go since you advise it.—But these cheeks</l>
<l n="320">Stript of their wholesome hue, these haggard eyes </l>
<l>Loud as the herald's throat will publish me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>The least delay may bring destruction now.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>I go, this bloody mantle will betray me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Whence is that blood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>It spouted from the veins</l>
<l>Of the unhappy man I mourned for Titus.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Hide it with strictest care from every eye.</l>
<l>Hold, as we pass we may exchange our robes,</l>
<l>I will take thine, these crimson drops wash'd out</l>
<l>(My chamber's near) I'll meet thee with the emperor.</l>
<l n="330">The presence of a friend may bring thee comfort.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Sextus.</speaker>
<l>'Tis all I have left—wilt thou still call me friend?</l>
<l>As just awaken'd from a hideous trance</l>
<l>The dreadful phantoms still encompass me.</l>
<l>I tread with fear, and doubting every step,</l>
<l>Am lost in the delirium.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>CONSPIRE against my life! said you not so?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Hoping my intercession might prevail</l>
<l>To obtain his pardon from your clemency,</l>
<l>One of the traitors made confession full.</l>
<l>The man you know, and like the chief he follow'd</l>
<l>A worthless object of your frequent bounty:</l>
<l>Yet to be prais'd in this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="49" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Then Lentulus</l>
<l>Is guilty. That bad man, unfit for trust,</l>
<l>Check'd by my power in his rapacity,</l>
<l>Wou'd wipe the memory out of past offence</l>
<l>But by transgressing deeper. In the account</l>
<l>Of foes like him I count my own desert.</l>
<l>His enmity's a laurel. But what further?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Lentulus, the impious Lentulus</l>
<l>Devised the enterprise, with mad design</l>
<l>To wrest Rome's sceptre from thy sacred hand.</l>
<l>He sired the capitol to raise the tumult,</l>
<l>And in the imperial robe and wreath expected</l>
<l>The giddy crowd, for ever fond of change,</l>
<l n="20">And ever for the worst, shou'd shout him up </l>
<l>A sovereign for his plumage. But the robe,</l>
<l>(How just is heaven) assumed for thy perdition,</l>
<l>Assured his own. One of the desperate band</l>
<l>Mistaking the impostor for the prince,</l>
<l>Drench'd in the blood of Lentulus his steel,</l>
<l>Deceived but by that garment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Is he dead?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Of that I'm yet to learn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Methinks 'tis strange</l>
<l>They cou'd so long conceal the bold design.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Oh generous prince! thou art not yet secure,</l>
<l n="30">Treason is round thee. See this crimson badge,</l>
<l>A riband such as this binds up the robe</l>

<l>Observe it, and be cautious.</l>

<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>My fair friend!</l>
<l>These are the joys of empire. Judge me Truth!</l>
<l>Have I not held my people's happiness</l>
<l>Much dearer than my own, yet all my cares</l>
<l>Are sown in barrenness, or shoot rank weeds</l>
<l>Choking the soil that nurs'd them. From my brow</l>
<l>One desperate hand wou'd tear this hard-earn'd wreath</l>
<l n="40">To wear it on his own, and still more strange </l>
<l>He finds abettors. Can it be in Rome?</l>
<l>Does Rome then hate thee, Titus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Think not so.</l>
<l>Think it a monster which the matron Rome</l>
<l>'Gainst Nature's course shook in convulsions forth,</l>
<l>Which when the startled parent found to swell</l>
<l>With venom dangerous to her proper life</l>
<l>With her own hands she strangled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Titus.</speaker>
<l>Heavenly Synod,</l>
<l>You know if I have serv'd her. You beheld</l>
<l>When on the banks of Ister or of Nile,</l>
<l n="50">Patient I felt the changing season's rage,</l>
<l>Or scorch'd in sultry Syria for her glory,</l>
<l>For her indulgence, cruel to myself,</l>
<l>I stifled my affections, banish'd from me</l>
<l>The first dear object of a mutual passion.</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="59"/>And thus (my tears will fall) ingrateful Rome</l>
<l>Even thus am I requited.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Never yet</l>
<l>Was man so vile, or enterprize so wild,</l>
<l>Scorn'd or detested by the general sense,</l>

<l>Sextus welcome!</l>
<l>How oft have we reproved our satyrists</l>
<l>For dark'ning Nature with black characters</l>
<l>Impress'd but by their spleen, nor could believe</l>
<l>The principles of ill so widely sown</l>
<l>In human bosoms to give countenance</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Is this their love?</l>
<l>O thou vile city, that but yesterday</l>
<l>Cast forth thy tribes to shout him to the sky,</l>
<l>Deaf'ning the ears of Jove, now to the Circus</l>
<l>To see him mangled, his poor heart torn out,</l>
<l>They fly as volleying sires pursued their speed,</l>
<l>Nor cast one look behind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="77"/>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>His blood this hour</l>
<l>Will glut their savage curiosity.</l>
<l>The surly keepers by the senate's order</l>
<l>From the gaunt lions hold their wonted food</l>
<l>To whet their fierceness for the barbarous meal.</l>
<l n="110">I saw their glaring eyes, heard the deep growl </l>
<l>Portentous of the carnage they expected.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>I am most miserible. My exulting heart</l>
<l>Beat high with joy to find thee innocent,</l>
<l>But oh I little thought, a husband's honour</l>
<l>Cou'd be redeem'd but by a brother's death.</l>
<l>Is no way left to save him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>None but one,</l>
<l>And that he has rejected. I was present,</l>
<l>A weeping witness of the interview.</l>
<l>Soften'd almost to tears the gracious prince</l>
<l n="120">By the dear memory of their early friendship,</l>
<l>By duty, faith and gratitude adjured him</l>
<l>To make a full confession of the cause</l>
<l>Which wrought him to the attempt. By such compliance</l>
<l>Deep in oblivion to entomb offence,</l>
<l>And give him back the wonted place he held,</l>
<l>First in his soul's affection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Cou'd my brother</l>
<l>Hear it unmoved?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Oh no, his streaming eyes,</l>
<l>His breast convuls'd with passion, deep fetch'd groans,</l>
<l><pb n="70" facs="78"/>Proclaim'd th' unutterable agony.</l>
<l>Prostrate to earth he fell, avow'd his crime,</l>
<l>And in the frantic vehemence of grief</l>
<l>Call'd blessings on his injured master's head,</l>
<l>And curses on his own. But to reveal</l>
<l>The cause of his revolt, nor threats, nor prayers,</l>
<l>Favor, nor life, nor fear of death could move him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>Then what remains for me. I vainly hoped</l>
<l>A sister's tears might move him. From our infancy</l>
<l>The tenderest union twined our hearts in love.</l>
<l>Like blossoms from one parent stock we grow,</l>
<l n="140">Put forth the opening buds of youth together,</l>
<l>And both at once must wither. Oh believe it!</l>
<l>So dear, so vital is my fondness for him</l>
<l>To save my brother's blood I'd meet pale death</l>
<l>And clasp him like a bridegroom. My next hope</l>
<l>Was in the emperor's pity, he alas</l>
<l>Forbids my intercession.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Never saw I</l>
<l>Passion so shake him. His last wrathful words,</l>
<l>(I hear their thunder still) "hence to thy doom,</l>
<l>"Unnatural were thy deeds, thy end be dreadful."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l n="150">I rack my thoughts in vain. Yet oh I know </l>
<l>Were he not bound by some delusive tie</l>
<l>Of spurious honour to this fatal silence,</l>
<l>His soul wou'd yield to friendship's sympathy,</l>
<l><pb n="71" facs="79"/>Nor hide this secret canker which within</l>
<l>Consumes his life in silence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Annius.</speaker>
<l>Thine too with it.</l>
<l>But when were crimes confined in consequence?</l>
<l>Yet leave me nought untried. Go seek the emperor,</l>
<l>Again embrace his knees, shew thy sad eyes.</l>
<l>There is in woman's tears a melting power,</l>
<l n="160">Man's nature can't attain, nor man resist.</l>
<l>Perhaps he may relent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cornelia.</speaker>
<l>He must, he shall.</l>
<l>God of persuasion! with prevailing sounds</l>
<l>Endue thy suppliant's tongue, such as may wrest</l>
<l>The brandish'd bolt from this imperial Jove,</l>
<l>Quench the red lightning of his terrible eye,</l>
<l>And for the fiery shaft of ruthless ire,</l>

<l>But when, or where, or why the mode began,</l>
<l>Tell it some stage-read scholar, if he can.</l>
<l>I know enough for me, that 'tis the fashion,</l>
<l>Which governs this, and every other nation.</l>
<l>And yet to try with some poor paltry jest</l>
<l>To chase all tragic feelings from the breast,</l>
<l>Appears to my weak judgment, let me own,</l>
<l n="10">Like filling of the pail, to kick it down.</l>
<l>Nor less absurd than if some beauteous queen</l>
<l>With mantle flowing and majestic mein,</l>
<l>More admiration of her charms to gain</l>
<l>Shou'd chuse a Monkey to bear up her train.</l>
<l>Pray tell would Handel's oratorio's please</l>
<l>If clos'd with <hi>Bobbin Joan,</hi> or <hi>Butter'd Peas?</hi></l>
<l>Yet since the tyrant custom bids us try,</l>
<l>To make you laugh, whom we before made cry,</l>
<l>I wish with all my heart our Proteus poet</l>
<l n="20">Had rhym'd me something merry that would do it.</l>
<l><pb facs="92"/>No matter what, of homely Gills, or Jacks,</l>
<l>Or Beaux with spider legs, and lizard backs.</l>
<l>How the bold spirit of the modern dame</l>
<l>Throned in her car, drives the high road to fame,</l>
<l>While more delight the labour can afford,</l>
<l>To rule four coursers, than obey one lord.</l>
<l>Behold, incumbent o'er her ponies backs,</l>
<l>The sounding lash our female Jehu smacks,</l>
<l>Thro' her small fingers plys her skilful reins,</l>
<l n="30">And cheers the nags with hoarse equestrian strains.</l>
<l>"Gee Rainbow, Peacock, Button, gee along</l>
<l>Then squares her elbows, and confounds the throng</l>
<l>While her soft bosom too robustly feels,</l>
<l>A man like glory from her kindling wheels.</l>
<l>At these perhaps you have sometimes laugh'd before,</l>
<l>Yet faith I wish you'd laugh at them once more.</l>
<l>I'd do my best to oblige you, as I live,</l>
<l>Then in return for once to oblige me strive.</l>
<l>Nor now to modern France can we resort,</l>
<l n="40">Murder and crimes make melancholy sport.</l>
<l>Once, 'twas a happy land for all conditions,</l>
<l>Now, all is assignats and requisitions</l>
<l>Nor does the war with Holland promise much,</l>
<l>For who e'er brought home fancy from the Dutch?</l>
<l>Pepper and cheese they had, let us not wrong 'em,</l>
<l>But scarce one sprig of bays e'er grew among 'em.</l>
<l><pb facs="93"/>The use of language as most travellers tell</l>
<l>They think, was only given to buy and sell,</l>
<l>And when three weighty words, the price is spoke,</l>
<l n="50">Mynheer sinks down again to mum and smoke.</l>
<l>But now 'tis time to drop the mimic art,</l>
<l>And breathe one wish that swells each honest heart.</l>
<l>May Britain's son's with victory by their side</l>
<l>Make Holland shake, and humble Gallia's pride</l>
<l>The God of battle thro' all dangers guard 'em,</l>
<l>And their best meed, a Nation's thanks reward 'em!</l>
