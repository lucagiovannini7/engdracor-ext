</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NED.</speaker>
<p>A vast, belay your jaw a little, until I have overhaul'd my limbs, and see that none of them are unshipped. So, so, all's right and tight. <stage>(Feeling about his limbs.)</stage> Ha, where are we?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>Why we are somewhere; and that's some satisfaction; we are upon an island, and I hope it is inhabited; for my swimming has made me hungry; a mouthful of salt water is as good to me as a glass of bitters. I have found my appetite, and the next thing, I hope, I shall find, will be some provision to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NED.</speaker>
<p>We shall find something to eat, or be eaten ourselves, I suppose; for the wild beasts of these woods, are as sharp set as we are, and keep a better look-out too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, though we are cast away, do not let us be cast down; here's a spring of fresh water, let us take a hatful, and be merry over it; it is better being here than as we were last night, in the sea, swimming about like so many blind puppies in a horse-pond; and as to eating, it is very well we did not give the sharks a supper.</p>

<p>They are villains.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<p>I grant it fair resentment, but now they are captives, we must not insult them. I am an English officer; it is our country's character, to face the foe, but not afflict the wretched.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>An please your honourableness, while you hold a council what's to be done with them, suppose Ned and I belay them to yon bamboo tree, back to back, like three skewered rabbits ready for spitting.</p>

<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>My brave deliverer, for my safety thus I thank you.</p>
<stage>Kneels.</stage>
<p>Let me beg you'll order your men to carry those villains to my father's court; he is an Indian, and king of this country. Be not amazed that I am of your complexion, and speak your languaget my mother came from England big with child of me, and here, upon those rocks, was the ship she was in cast away, her life, almost by a miracle, saved. After I was born, the king married her, he loved me as if I was his own child. If you are in doubt of trusting yourself with me, here will I stay, drink the clear spring wa;er with you. bring you the season fruit to feed on, dress your cave with every fine fowl's feather, make your bed with wild beasts skins, and henceforth be your handmaid.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter the two sailers.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>An't please your noble worship's honour and glory, we have brought up the three Frenchmen to their moorings; we spliced their hands abaft, then took a round twin about their shoulders, so their faces are hauled close alongside one another, and they look just like the sign of the three logger-heads.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Come, friends, follow your captain and me, and bring these rascally Frenchmen with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<p>How many more of our ship's crew have you seen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>No body, sir, an please your commodoreship, except the wild Irishman with the hard name, he's rarely sous'd, faith; he wouldn't stay to dry himself upon the rock as we did; there he tacks, see there, at the larboard side of the sugar plantation, just to leeward of us.</p>

<sp>
<p>Arrah faith the devil shall do himself good with me if ever I go into the water again before I have learn'd to swim; by my shoul they have made a fool of my father's son, to fill both my two ears full of fine speeches about what a fine country I should tread upon, when I put my feet into salt water; I wish I had staid in the cellar of the ship, and so indeed I wou'd, only I was afraid the captain wou'd have sail'd away without me.</p>

<p>I swam upon my hands and feet across an empty small beer barrel.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>Where's the barrel? I'm devilish dry, and small beer is worth drinking when strong is not to be had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Don't I tell you it was empty, and faith so it was, for I fill'd it myself with sweet salt water, as fresh as
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>I cou'd get it, and made a hole with my cut and thrust in the shore of the sand, and there I put all the small beer to hide it for my own drinking.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<p>In <hi>England,</hi> gracious king, my sovereign reigns, and by his order I was sent to check the audacious insults of his enemies, and with me two hundred of as brave Britons, as ever clapp'd match to a cannon's touch hole; but a dreadful storm defeated our best skill, we were forc'd, at the back of your island, to run our ship ashore, the rest your daughter better can relate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>As I beneath a cotton tree was sat, by a long chace fatigued, my bow unstrung, yon three lewd ruffians seiz'd upon your daughter; resistance on my side I found was vain; I begg'd, I wept; I pray'd in vain to them; to heaven I sent my shrieks, and this brave man by heaven was sent to me; he attack'd the robbers, he saved my life, and preserved me from destruction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<p>Thrice, thrice, thrice, thanks brave Englishman be yours, bring forth the Wampum belt, wear it brave Sir.
<stage><hi>The belt brought on. While the belt is put on about the captain, four blacks dance round him with tabors in their hands, to the tune of</hi> Nivelon's <hi>Clown's Dance.</hi></stage> And for a farther token of our friendship with thee, we'll smoke the calumet of peace.</p>
<stage>All sit down with their pipes.</stage>

<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>So I am nobody at all I suppose, but I'll be after taking my tobacco for all that; arrah mushee cushee captain, desire one of those charcoal gentlemen to be after putting a whisper upon the king, about myself; for since I find you all about to do nothing at all, I'll come and help ye, because I don't love to be idle. <stage>A pipe is given him, he looks a little at it, and then breaks it in three pieces and puts it in his pocket.</stage> By my should man and a cute thing it is; I'll carry it home with me, and because the custom house officers shan't seize it for being undutiful, I'll crack it in halves in three places, and then the devil a rap will I pay them for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<p>Go Oran Outong, draw our troops together, and bring an hundred battoes down the creek; and you, brave Sir, shall, if you please, be captain, we'll fight beneath your standard.</p>

<p>Pleas'd indeed I shall be to revenge our country's cause on these encroaching French; I'm ready.</p>

<p>Ay, ay, and may that man among us be cut into four pound pieces, and put into the devil's pickling tub, that won't face a Frenchman, I say.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>NED.</speaker>
<p>Well said Ben, amen, messmate; I have but one life to lose, but I am for making a good voyage with it. However, though it be but a short one, I wou'dn't be one of your fine save all folks, who wou'd burn out life to a snuff, and end their days in a stink.</p>

<stage><pb n="14" facs="16"/><hi>Enter Black Lady and Princess.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>I hope my princess will not think me rude, but while our warriors are executing their enterprize, I flatter myself I have discovered something will amuse you. The sailors have left behind them a wild man, who has professed himself my lover, I have persuaded him there's an old witch, in a cave hard by, and if he can cut off her head, he is to have me, and a large plantation for this pains. With your highness's leave I'll hide in the cave the large pasteboard image you have made; and after he has in the dark cut off the head, I can make him believe she will haunt him for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Pray let me see this man, and while I examine him, you may prepare the image.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Black Woman.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mac. <hi>bowing very low.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Who are you, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Any body, at your service, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>From whence came you, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>From a little potatoe estate, in the Queen's county, where all the rest of us lives; and by my shoul, my father would be glad to see you there; for he has been blind these ten years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Have you a house there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Faith have I, and as pretty a house as ever you set your loving eyes upon, tho' there was a little accident happened to the top of it; for it set itself on fire, and I run away by the light of it; but I have got the key of the
<pb n="15" facs="17"/>street door in my pocket; and that is some satisfaction, you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>How came you to take a fancy to the sea, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>I never did, faith, but it took such a fancy to me yesterday, that I thought it would never let me get out of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>How came you then to go to sea?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Why I had a mind to make my fortune among the islands upon the continent; for I had read all the history books of antipathy; so I vowed to be doing something, as well as paddy Julius Caesar did; so I agreed with one captain Bowwo to carry me over sea with him; but I told him I would not stand to any damages; for if the ship sunk in the middle of the sea, before we got half over, he must get another to carry me in, or the Devil a rap I would give him for my passage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, pray go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>So then I stepped head foremost into the ship; but when they set it a running, oh, I thought I should die every minute, and I got drunk with the smell of the sea water; I called out to them to stop the ship, but the Devil a word would they hear on their ears about it; so at last we could see no land, but what was quite out of sight, so I clapped my back against the great big stick that grew out of the middle of the floor of the ship, to look about me; but then the clouds turned black in the face, the waves in the water began to grow big belly'd, and the Captain swore, and the sailors cry'd, a lake, a lake, but the Devil a lake or onion either could I see; then they bothered about, and said, Run the ship ashore, Run the ship ashore; but I wanted to run myself ashore, and not the ship; and so I
<pb n="16" facs="18"/>told the Captain, for I would be going upon dry land, I said, tho' I was up to my neck in the mud.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Black Woman.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>It is time, the witch is asleep.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<p>Good luck go with you, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>As to that, my jewel, whether good luck goes with me, or is after following me, never heed that; but, madam, I hope you'll be after putting yourself in mind, after I have cut off this old witch's head, that this lady shall be man and wife to me; no, I don't mean so neither, that I shall be man and wife to this lady. Devil burn me, that's not it neither; I mean that as we are, one flesh; so when the parson joins us we shall be two together.</p>

<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>Now draw your sword, she lies with her head towards us, but be sure you don't wake her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Not till I have cut her head off, my dear, and then if she wakes what matters it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>You must creep upon your hands and knees.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="19"/>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Then I should have something to put under my feet, you know, my dear, for fear I should make a noise.</p>

<p>In, in, in.</p>

<p>Our princess wants you, and our monarch has ordered rewards to the English sailors.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Arrah, faith, honey, and here's her skull sure enough; she was devilish light headed, upon my shoul; for it is not so heavy as a good potatoe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>Now, sir, come with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Stay, my jewel, let us shut up the door of the cave with a great big stone; for fear the old witch should have a mind to come out for her head again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>Do you think she can walk without her head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Why there's nothing at all in that; there was St. Patrick's horse once lost his head at the battle of Clogher, and he galloped nine miles without it, and never would have miss'd it, only as he crossed a river he stooped down to drink, so then he found he had lost it.</p>

<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Devil burn me if I do, so do not bother me, be easy can't you; for if you'll believe me, you become the loss of your head as well as any woman in all Ireland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IMAGE.</speaker>
<p>Give me my head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>That I would with all my heart, my dear, only I want it myself, because two heads, you know, are better than one.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>Come, go with me to the court, and assist at the triumph and entry the King makes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Ah, and by my shoul, I'll be after showing this head to the King; so hear you mrs. witch, by my shoul, I don't know which to speak to, the head or the body; here one of you answer me; but if you can't, why tell me so. Stay here a little, just while I lose myself, and then, if you find me, I'll give you your own head for nothing, and mine at the same price.</p>

<stage>A shout behind the Scenes. Enter two sailors with a large bundle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>Avast, Ned, let's overhaul our plunder.</p>
<stage>They open the bundle and pull out two large muffs and bag wigs, and a powder engine, two old fashioned laced shirts with ruffles sewed into the sleeves. They powder and dress themselves and put the muffs upon their legs, and then compliment one another.</stage>

<speaker>NED.</speaker>
<p>Where does her voice come from?</p>

<p>Why out of her stomach you fool you, because she has been forc'd to eat her words lately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>If I had her for a wife, now wou'd our children have any brains?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="22"/>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>There's nothing in that my jewel, for my father bought a cropt mare to breed horses without ears, but it wou'd not do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NED.</speaker>
<p>Let's carry her to the captain.</p>
</sp>

<p>Ah, and take me along with you, because you know as I carry her head in my fist, I can put in a word for her, as she can't speak for herself.</p>

<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<p>How now, what's all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="23"/>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>Arrah, never seem to mind it, my jewel, it is nothing at all, not that neither, only this old witch wants her head again, and I want to sell it; and, faith, if every body that wanted a head would be after coming to me, by my shoul I should have three halves of the world for my customers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<p>May it please your honourableship's nobleness, our crew has no mind to come into the dock of matrimony, and for my part I don't care to sail any longer without a consort; so, if you please, I should like this gentlewoman to stow under my hatches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>By my shoul but she was after being promis'd to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLACK WOMAN.</speaker>
<p>No, sir, you are better provided for; for since you have got that lady's head, it can be no harm to you to take the rest of her body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAC.</speaker>
<p>But I'll live single first all the days of my life, and a day afterwards; so, my jewel, I beg you'll speak to the king for to make me a gentleman of horse, or a maid of honour in the same troop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<l>Now, my lads, let's all rejoice,</l>
<l>And for our king and country raise our voice,</l>
<l>Let envy feeding discontented elves,</l>
<l>Who fancy all men blockheads but themselves,</l>
<l>Rail right or wrong, dispute, deny, debate,</l>
<l>And if they miss their pension, damn the state.</l>
<l>Then praise the French, French diet let them chuse,</l>
<l>Soup meagre, frogs, sour wine, and wooden shoes;</l>
<l>Such abject minds bend to the tyrant's scourge,</l>
<l>But let us boldly say, God bless King George.</l>
