<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>WHEREE'ER Mankind to sacred freedom just,</l>
<l>Have soar'd above the groveling Sons of dust,</l>
<l>Wheree'er the Arts their fragrant wreathes have wove,</l>
<l>Wheree'er the virtues leagued with Patriot love,</l>
<l>And bright-eyed Science shed her heavenly dews,</l>
<l>There public taste hath nursed the Tragic Muse.</l>
<l>And Reason to her generous care consign'd,</l>
<l>The noblest, best emotions of the mind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Tis her's where human institutes are weak,</l>
<l>With firm, unbiast emphasis to speak.</l>
<l>With genuine nature link persuasive art,</l>
<l>And bind in magic ties the willing heart.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>She gives to view the Tyrant's naked breast,</l>
<l>What guilt disturbs him, and what fears insest.</l>
<l>She with abhorrence marks the Traitor's name,</l>
<l>And cloaths Ambition in the robes of Shame.</l>
<l>Depresses Cruelty; and rears on high</l>
<l>The standard of Imperial liberty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Is Innocence by rigour stern subdued?</l>
<l>She steels her soul with conscious fortitude.</l>
<l>Bids her above this fordid earth to rise,</l>
<l>And claim alliance with her native skies.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Who then, by partial error led astray,</l>
<l>With hasty censure brands the Tragic lay?</l>
<l>The glorious strains which polish'd Athens taught,</l>
<l>Refining and exalting human thought?</l>
<l>When Sages praised the Poet's moral pen?</l>
<l>And listening Heroes felt that they were Men?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What true desert is their's, at Virtue's call,</l>
<l>Who make th' obedient passions rise or fall!</l>
<l>Who in her Temple bid Mankind appear,</l>
<l>Breathe the warm sigh, and drop the hallow'd tear!</l>
<l>For when by idcot laughter unpossest,</l>
<l>She, gentle Goddess, seeks the soften'd breast.</l>
<l>From grief itself a nameless pleasure flows,</l>
<l>And pity loves to melt at fancied woes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Not through Antiquity's obscurer ways,</l>
<l>To climes remote our British Author strays,</l>
<l>Not from th' Italian, or the French translates,</l>
<l>Alters old plots, or even imitates.</l>
<l>From your own Annals he his story draws,</l>
<l>Tradition long hath crown'd it with applause.</l>
<l>When the fierce Danes their barbarous inroads plann'd,</l>
<l>And pour'd destruction o'er each harrast land.</l>
<l>When they besieged these Walls, and hoped to win,</l>
<l>Nor knew superior valour dwelt within:</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="4"/>Till the bold Citizens assail'd their Host,</l>
<l>And drove th' insulting Miscreants from their Coast,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus, for their Country, dared your Sires to bleed;</l>
<l>Nor have their Sons disgraced the gallant deed.</l>
<l>Courageous now, as when they quell'd the Dane,</l>
<l>Still faithful, loyal, generous, and humane.</l>

<stage>VOLNIR. BRITHRIC.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>SHALL not this City fall beneath my power?</l>
<l>What magic buckler guards it? To my arms,</l>
<l>The puny Offspring of this sea-girt land</l>
<l>Have yielded wheresoe'er I fought. My ships</l>
<l>Beneath their treasures bend. The ravaged coast,</l>
<l>Hence, to the farthest Orcades, laments</l>
<l>Her slaughter'd Chiefs, and desolated towns.</l>
<l>What say'st thou Englishman! Our first assault</l>
<l>Hath proved in vain, will they withstand another?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>No doubt they will. In native courage bold,</l>
<l>The warlike Sons of Isca ne'er will droop</l>
<l>By sudden fear o'ercome. To conquer them,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="6"/>Patience, with ardent valour must be joined,</l>
<l>Nor will they yield, till closed within the net</l>
<l>Of extreme fate, and dire necessity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>How dost thou know their character so well?</l>
<l>I thought thou told'st me, thou wert born far off,</l>
<l>Upon the banks of Trent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>I told thee true.</l>
<l>But who, within these confines, is a stranger</l>
<l>To the Damnonian fame? Their worth in arms</l>
<l>Even their foes confess. Before these walls</l>
<l>For two long tedious months did Sweno mourn,</l>
<l>Illustrious Monarch, and with shame and rage</l>
<l>Beheld his blasted laurels. Nor at length,</l>
<l>But by a Norman traitor gain'd the place,</l>
<l>Ignobly gain'd it. Why, O ill-advised,</l>
<l>Would'st thou sit down before it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Brithric, hold!</l>
<l>No more with thy ill-omen'd notes presume</l>
<l>T' infest my ear. Hast thou forgot, old man,</l>
<l>When first I saw thee in thy boarded ship,</l>
<l>The sad survivor of thy vanquish'd crew,</l>
<l>Cover'd with wounds? When I preserv'd thy life,</l>
<l>And made my foe my friend? For Volnir ne'er</l>
<l>After the rage of fight, could plunge his sword</l>
<l>In the unguarded bosom of the brave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>No Volnir, I can ne'er forget that day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast forgot it; else why interpose</l>
<l>These frigid cautions? Hast thou e'er with arm</l>
<l>Or counsels, aided me, since first I urg'd</l>
<l>The tide of war against the Anglian shore?</l>
<l>Now, by my sword I swear, when I have gain'd</l>
<l>Some glorious victory, these eyes have seen</l>
<l>Thy cheek bedew'd with tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>And say, could'st thou</l>
<l>View Ruin with gigantic stride, pass o'er</l>
<l>Thy Denmark's breast unmov'd? No, surely no</l>
<l>In other realms thou hast not seen these feet</l>
<l>Behind thee linger; my victorious arm</l>
<l>Gothland hath witness'd, and the Frank, the Scot</l>
<l>Oft fled before the lightning of my spear.</l>
<l>These were my enemies as well as thine.</l>
<l>But can a private tye, e'en gratitude</l>
<l>Strongest of all, make me forget the love</l>
<l>I owe my country? Perish then this arm!</l>
<l>May these white locks unseemly strew the dust!</l>
<l>When my advice shall prompt, or hands dare execut</l>
<l>A guilty deed against my native soil!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Why hath thy native soil ne'er paid thy ransom?</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="8"/>For well I know, thou art not of the race</l>
<l>Of common men.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Why ask of me a question</l>
<l>Thou best can'st answer? Would'st thou have permitted</l>
<l>A messenger from me to seek my friends,</l>
<l>Long, long e'er now my ransom had been paid.</l>
<l>Thou know'st, tho' pleased, the more enlighten'd manners,</l>
<l>And customs of well-regulated States</l>
<l>By my instructions taught, t' exalt me high</l>
<l>Amid thy Warriors, Conqueror as thou art,</l>
<l>Thou know'st I have not willingly forsaken</l>
<l>Those I held dear. I left my soul's best portion,</l>
<l>A valued Wife; a young and growing Daughter,</l>
<l>An infant Son I left. Could I forget</l>
<l>In splendid slavery these tender names?</l>
<l>For life I am thy Debtor, and have serv'd</l>
<l>In other wars most faithfully. But still</l>
<l>Affection wrings my heart, and liberty</l>
<l>Is unpossess'd, tho' I without a boast</l>
<l>Might claim it as my due.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Go, join the foe.</l>
<l>Hence murmurer to the city, and betray</l>
<l>Me, and my army.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Volnir no, I scorn</l>
<l>The paths of baseness. Prisoner, to thee,</l>
<l>Unransom'd never will I quit thy camp.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> RODOLPH, <hi>with</hi> EDITHA, <hi>and other</hi> PRISONERS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Welcome brave Rodolph! Hast thou well explor'd</l>
<l>The country toward the North?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I have. No foe</l>
<l>Dares stand against us, terror-struck they fly,</l>
<l>And leave to us their numerous herds and flocks.</l>
<l>I traced yon winding stream for many a mile,</l>
<l>Through it's luxuriant vale, fit haunt for Gods.</l>
<l>Unlike our blasted heaths, here Plenty dwells,</l>
<l>Clad in her richest robes. Could we possess</l>
<l>The City, with this scene before our view,</l>
<l>Here might we fix our home, and each nerve strung</l>
<l>With double vigour, brave the utmost force</l>
<l>Of the whole adverse Isle. A region this,</l>
<l>Worthy of none but Denmark's valiant race.</l>
<l>Bear off these Prisoners. To my Tent conduct</l>
<l>This trembling fair One. Fear not, gentle Damsel,</l>
<l>Rodolph is thy Protector.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Stay awhile.</l>
<l>Whence is that beauteous Maid?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>A votaress She.</l>
<l>Immur'd within a neighbouring abbeys walls.</l>
<l>We burst the gate, and took her thence by force.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="10"/>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Enough. Retire. <stage>(<hi>Exeunt</hi> Editha, &amp;c.</stage> Rodolph, it ill becomes</l>
<l>A soldier in the clamorous field of war</l>
<l>To sigh at Beauty's feet. 'Tis our's to teach</l>
<l>The eager sword to bite the crested helm:</l>
<l>To call the hawks of Heaven, and bid them mark</l>
<l>The joys of fight; to drench the ground in blood.</l>
<l>Nor, 'till return'd from war, to take the Maid,</l>
<l>Or blooming Widow to our wish'd embrace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Fear not my Chief; guarded with sacred care</l>
<l>She dwells secure, 'till placed within my ship,</l>
<l>A matchless prize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>So shall thy Chief applaud thee</l>
<l>Now hear what we have purposed. Be it thine</l>
<l>To head a daring Band by me selected,</l>
<l>And when the moon dips in the cave of night</l>
<l>Her silver brow, to scale with silent step</l>
<l>Yon castle walls; myself will on the city</l>
<l>Pour my whole force, and with incessant storm</l>
<l>Facilitate thy enterprize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>My thoughts</l>
<l>Accord with thine. Plan thou each arduous deed:</l>

<head>SCENE III.</head>
<stage>VOLNIR. BRITHRIC.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Mark'd you the Virgin?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>I observed her well.</l>
<l>Her modesty, her air above the vulgar,</l>
<l>Her unaffected, silent look of woe,</l>
<l>With strange emotions fill'd my heart. I pity her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Her fate is to be envied. Rodolph's valour</l>
<l>Deserves the fairest. Where can beauty feel</l>
<l>True pleasure, but when clasp'd in the embrace</l>
<l>Of the intrepid warrior?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Tender mourner!</l>
<l>Who knows her grief! Her sad anxiety!</l>
<l>Torn from her Friends! Perhaps an aged Father</l>
<l>Now beats his breast, and curses in despair,</l>
<l>The cruel hand of Fate. A frantic Mother</l>
<l>Perhaps now breathes her last, in anguish wild,</l>
<l>Calling in vain upon her much-loved Daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>I blush to hear this weakness; glad am I</l>
<l>None of my noble Danes are witnesses</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="12"/>To this thy folly; but if thou regard'st</l>
<l>My anger, dare not with inglorious wailings</l>
<l>Disgrace my camp. War is no school of pity.</l>
<l>Nor would I, that the spirits of my followers,</l>
<l>Rough and invincible, be e'er degraded</l>
<l>To the soft failings of the silken Crew,</l>
<l>O'er whom they triumph. Why is strength imparted,</l>
<l>Why the heroic soul, but from the base</l>
<l>Unmanly grasp of cowards, those possessions</l>
<l>They merit not to wrest? Riches and beauty,</l>
<l>The harvest of their labours?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Is it then</l>
<l>Denied to feel for the afflicted?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>No;</l>
<l>But rule thy feelings; like a man, support</l>
<l>Thy nature's frailty; feed on grief in secret.</l>
<stage>(<hi>Exit.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>O curse! to bear a mind whence sweet humanity</l>
<l>By barbarous custom is exiled! To know</l>
<l>No virtue, but ferocious brutal courage!</l>
<l>Yet is this Chief superior to his race;</l>
<l>And education which hath steel'd his soul</l>
<l>To gentle pity, hath not quite erased</l>
<l>The native sense of rectitude. He spared</l>
<l>My life; and loved a valour like his own.—</l>
<l>The thoughts of this poor Virgin still distress me,</l>
<l>Such is my Daughter's age.—But she's far distant.</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="13"/>It cannot be.—And yet her Mother's features</l>
<l>Rose to my mind.—'Tis but the sport of fancy.—</l>
<l>Oh! could I but once more behold my Children,</l>
<l>I then could die in peace.—But who can tell</l>
<l>Whether some other band of these invaders</l>
<l>May not have slain, or hurried them away</l>
<l>To sad captivity? Perhaps I mourn</l>
<l>The absence of the dead; or dead to me,</l>
<l>Who never must behold them; doom'd to waste</l>
<l>My days in misery, and die a slave.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> RODOLPH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Hast thou so soon left thy fair Prisoner?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>New to misfortune is the Maid; her sorrow</l>
<l>Resists all arguments; persuasion fails;</l>
<l>Nor will she hear a word of soothing comfort.</l>
<l>She will be calm anon. These warmer passions</l>
<l>Soonest abate. Yet, 'twas a scene of terror</l>
<l>From whence I snatch'd her; for the foolish crew</l>
<l>Their gates had barricadoed, which provoked</l>
<l>My gallant band to deeds of vengeance. All</l>
<l>But she, and one, whom at a postern door</l>
<l>A youth bore off upon his rapid steed,</l>
<l>Fell victims to the keen relentless sword.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Whence were the other Captives?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="14"/>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>They were taken</l>
<l>From neighbouring villages, the soldier's plunder,</l>
<l>To them by lot distributed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Would'st thou,</l>
<l>Should I request it, suffer me to visit</l>
<l>This Captive in thy Tent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Hah! dost thou know</l>
<l>What 'tis thou ask'st?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>I do. Thou would'st be willing</l>
<l>To dry her tears?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I would.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>'Tis for that purpose</l>
<l>I ask an interview. I am her Countryman,</l>
<l>And should I to her ear unfold thy worth,</l>
<l>Thy excellence above the other Chiefs;</l>
<l>Make her of that good fortune sensible,</l>
<l>Which, 'mid her depth of woe, to thy possession</l>
<l>Devoted her; may not her mind be moved,</l>
<l>Sooth'd by the cheering speech of honest age,</l>
<l>And cast anxiety aside?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="15"/>
<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>I'll trust thee.</l>
<l>Thy snowy head proclaims, that in thy breast</l>
<l>The flame of warm desire's long since extinct.</l>
<l>Go Brithric. I would bend her to my wishes,</l>
<l>But not reluctantly. The sickly appetite</l>
<l>Of impotence may provocation need</l>
<l>In cold resistance, but my glowing soul</l>
<l>Seeks equal passion, and the yielding fair</l>
<l>To bless, must covet blessing.—Hence, away!</l>
<l>I wait on Volnir; He hath now demanded</l>
<l>Once more a parley; and the haughty Albert,</l>
<l>Exonia's Praefect, to our Camp draws nigh.</l>
<stage>(<hi>Exit.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRITHRIC.</speaker>
<l>Protect these towers, kind Heaven! Tho' for the sins</l>
<l>Of guilty nations, for a time these robbers</l>
<l>Bear thy vindictive scourge; yet, teach mankind</l>
<l>At length, that sacrilege and cruelty</l>
<l>Will draw the terrors of thy justice down!</l>
<l>That Mercy is thy darling attribute,</l>
<l>And thy arm bared to punish, not destroy!</l>

<l>Once more my noble friends, who chose me willingly</l>
<l>Your leader in this war, I mean to try,</l>
<l>Whether by mild persuasion, or by threats,</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="16"/>This Albert may be shaken. For tho' frankly</l>
<l>You rush amid the tempest of the fight,</l>
<l>To you not dreadful, and pour forth your blood,</l>
<l>As well becomes the brave; yet do ye know</l>
<l>To relish life, and all its genuine pleasures.</l>
<l>For this we leave our barren rocks, to tear</l>
<l>From the luxurious arms of battening sloth,</l>
<l>Its wealth superfluous, and its gorgeous robes,</l>
<l>Rich gems, and spur to every great design</l>
<l>The love-exciting Fair. Nor would I rashly,</l>

<l>Your feet to dangers fatal paths.—Should Albert,</l>
<l>Depending on its strength, refuse to yield</l>
<l>This well-girt city, He, like other Foes,</l>
<l>May buy our absence dearly, and bring forth</l>

<l>Think not Dane,</l>
<l>Tho' proud thy speech, that Albert's acts are govern'd</l>
<l>But by his own free will. 'Tis true I come,</l>
<l>And by thy message prompted; but expecting</l>

<l>Guarded by men, prepared as thou hast found,</l>
<l>Buried beneath their ruins to expire,</l>
<l>E'er stain their souls with infamy. I come,</l>
<l>Urged by an impulse to thy breast unknown,</l>
<l>That of humanity. To bid thee fly,</l>
<l>For vengeance is at hand; to bid thee spare</l>
<l>The streams of blood, which fate prepares to pour</l>
<l>Over these verdant fields. For tho' revenge</l>
<l>Inspires, tho' to the ravages of war</l>
<l>You join fell cruelty, tho' smoaking villages,</l>
<l>Women and children murder'd, well might steel</l>
<l>To dire retaliation all our hearts;</l>

<l>Thou can'st escape destruction. Flush'd with conquest</l>
<l>In every country from the frozen sea</l>

<l>So spiritless was our defence, when lately</l>
<l>We beat thee from our ramparts? When thy bravest</l>
<l>Fell at our feet in death? And the remainder</l>
<l>To their intrenchments fled? Can this have taught thee</l>

<l>In thunder on thee, as e'er long it will,</l>

<l><pb n="30" facs="34"/>To tell thee all; for as with stealthy pace,</l>
<l>Skreen'd by the gloom of night, thro' secret paths</l>
<l>The careful foe I shunn'd, methought I heard</l>
<l>A sound confused of feet and murmuring voices,</l>
<l>And strait the glimpse of armour caught my eye.</l>
<l>Some action is on foot; they seem'd to me</l>
<l>As winding t'ward the Castle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>Let them come.</l>
<l>They steal not on a sleeping enemy;</l>
<l>We are prepared: and as a lofty rock</l>
<l>Beats back the furious waves which rage in vain,</l>
<l>So shall before our well-mann'd battlements</l>
<l>These ravagers retire.—I see thy grief</l>
<l>Thou gallant Youth; and for thy hapless Sister</l>
<l>Feel similar emotions to thy own.</l>

<l>Unparagon'd in beauty, and in virtue.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>Oh! witness Heaven! no common love I bore her!</l>
<l>No Brother ever better loved a Sister;</l>
<l>And she deserved my love.—Her active soul</l>
<l>Soaring above the weakness of her sex,</l>
<l>My younger spirit raised to glorious daring.</l>
<l>When but a Boy, she to my listening ear,</l>
<l>Taught all the martial deeds of my great Ancestors.</l>
<l>She set before my eye my Father's virtues,</l>
<l>(Whose early death my Mother ever mourns:)</l>
<l>And bade me tread like them the paths of fame.</l>
<l><pb n="31" facs="35"/>If aught within this breast transcends the vulgar,</l>

<l>'Twas unfortunate—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>Oh! it was greatly so. That they should think</l>
<l>The ties of faith would check those lawless robbers!</l>
<l>That I should suffer them to put in practice</l>
<l>So idle a resolve! Exposed to danger,</l>
<l>When here with us they might have dwelt in safety.</l>
<l>For what is sacred to the Danish race?</l>
<l>They spare not hoary age, nor innocence</l>
<l>Within its Mother's clasping arms inshrined,</l>
<l>Nor e'en religion at the hallow'd altar.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>Would I could comfort thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>That wish is vain.</l>
<l>Nor seek I any comfort but revenge.</l>
<l>Join with me there my Friend! Let us this instant</l>
<l>Pour forth the tide of fury on their camp.</l>
<l>My eager sword is thirsty for revenge.</l>
<l>The holy Virgins weltering in their blood,</l>
<l>My ravish'd Sister's wrongs now urge me on,</l>
<l>String all my nerves, and fill my soul with ardour.</l>

<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast forgot thy tidings.—But whate'er</l>

<l>And deep upon the Danish crests, inscribe</l>
<l>In bloody characters, the holy compact.</l>

<l>A messenger, who told me e'er the sun</l>
<l>Set in the West, we should behold his camp</l>

<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Again repulsed! Again with shame compell'd</l>
<l>To seek our camp! The Danish Genius droops.</l>
<l>Oh! where was Rodolph's matchless valour! Where</l>
<l>That untamed spirit wont to rise superiour</l>
<l>To every obstacle! The waves of chance</l>
<l>To stem with steady breast, and gain the shore!</l>
<l>To press against the hand of opposition,</l>
<l>And urge his way more swiftly for resistance!</l>
<l>But love, fond love enslaved the Warrior's heart,</l>
<l>Beauty's soft chains had shackled his bold spirit,</l>

<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>These reproaches</l>
<l>No doubt become thee well. Injustice ever</l>
<l>With weak excuses vindicates its actions.</l>
<l>Scarce can I trust my ears; these taunts from thee!</l>
<l>But I'm perhaps a stranger, and thou never</l>
<l>Beheld'st my footsteps in the crimson field,</l>
<l>Or sword destructive dealing slaughter round.</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="39" ana="y"/>And didst thou take my Captive from my Tent?</l>
<l>And do I live and bear this injury?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>No more rash man. Learn thou thy duty better.</l>
<l>Did I not charge thee not to woe the Maid?</l>
<l>What! shall our camp be changed into a school</l>
<l>Of wanton dalliance? Of inglorious love?</l>
<l>Our deeds depend not on the breath of Rodolph.</l>
<l>We judge, we act, from reason's firm resolves.</l>

<speaker>RODOLPH.</speaker>
<l>Oh! would we were in Denmark! I should there</l>

<l>Who acts, who judges, as firm reason dictates!</l>
<l>He saw the beauteous prisoner, he loved her,</l>
<l>And from his envied Rival took the Maid.</l>

<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Retire. <stage>(<hi>To the Attendants.</hi>)</stage></l>
<l>Thy will is granted. From a messenger</l>
<l>So beauteous, and so rare, I may expect</l>
<l>No common tidings. Whence? and who art thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>From Devon's West extreme I come; a Friend</l>
<l>To thee and Denmark.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>How a Friend? Proceed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>Art thou ambitious o'er this town to triumph?</l>
<l>To gird the Conqueror's laurel round thy brow?</l>
<l>And all thy valiant host enrich with plunder?</l>
<l>A female tongue shall teach thee how to act.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Whoe'er thou art, whatever be thy counsel,</l>
<l>Thou read'st my wish aright.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>I am the Daughter</l>
<l>Of Oswy, powerful Chief, a name to thee</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="42"/>Well-known, my name Gunhilda. In our veins</l>
<l>Flows Danish blood; e'er that inhuman massacre</l>
<l>Destroy'd thy Countrymen, by holy union</l>
<l>Of marriage 'twas acquired.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Say on fair Damsel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>Thus then; my Father with a mighty aid</l>
<l>Is near at hand prepared to raise this siege;</l>
<l>So Albert credits, so the Citizens.</l>
<l>But if thy heart consents with his, to terms</l>
<l>Which I shall now propose, the town is thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>What bond coercive answers for his faith?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>I will remain with thee a willing Hostage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well; the terms unfold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>On Oswy's part</l>
<l>He promises, when Host with adverse Host</l>
<l>Is mix'd in fight, to fly with all his troops.</l>
<l>Then while the Citizens confusedly urge</l>
<l>Their way toward the walls, thy Friends may enter</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="43"/>With the affrighted croud. Or e'er two days</l>
<l>Are past, when he is in the City posted,</l>
<l>He will, the gate committed to his care,</l>
<l>To thee deliver at a certain hour.</l>
<l>From thee he asks in coin, in plate, or gems,</l>
<l>Secretly given, a third part of the spoil.</l>
<l>He wishes thee to curb impetuous rage,</l>
<l>Nor shed unnecessary blood, but one,</l>
<l>One odious life he at thy hands requires.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Name the devoted victim.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>Edred; he</l>
<l>Who every needy artizan inspires</l>
<l>With pride, and every vile mechanic breast</l>
<l>With obstinacy. He it is who checks thy course,</l>
<l>Thy greatest enemy and our's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>I know</l>
<l>The Youth; when first we for this siege prepared,</l>
<l>He came with Albert, and defied our power.</l>
<l>Bold were his words, and stately was his mien.</l>
<l>I saw him afterwards like lightning pierce</l>
<l>Our thickest ranks, his fury front to front</l>
<l>Rodolph opposed, and desperate was the fight;</l>
<l>But Rodolph's arm prevailed not. On he rush'd,</l>
<l>And havock mark'd his way. This night again</l>
<l>His valour foil'd us; he, our prisoners say,</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="44"/>The Citadel defended. We accept</l>
<l>Thy terms fair Stranger. To the noble Oswy,</l>
<l>We swear the third part of the spoil to give,</l>
<l>And Edred's forfeit life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>He asks no more.</l>
<l>The first he claims a debt of justice, due</l>
<l>From thee to his deserts; the last, a sacrifice</l>
<l>To the diminish'd honour of his house,</l>
<l>And sullied name. 'Twere long, nor need I tell</l>
<l>The cause of his desired revenge; enough</l>
<l>That Edred is beyond expression base,</l>
<l>Vile, contumelious, and that we would see,</l>
<l>With pleasure see this Island from its base</l>
<l>Torn by an earthquake, and with all its rocks</l>
<l>Plunged in the main, so he might sink beneath</l>
<l>The ponderous ruins.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Be it as thou wilt</l>
<l>My generous Hostage. We will pay the debt</l>
<l>Of justice and of vengeance. Were he placed</l>
<l>Within our power, had he a thousand lives</l>
<l>He dies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNHILDA.</speaker>
<l>That thought gives comfort to my soul.</l>
<l>For that I braved the horrors of the night,</l>
<l>That steel'd the weaker nature of my sex,</l>
<l>And brought me hither spite of danger's frown,</l>
<l>And the pale eye of fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="45"/>
<speaker>VOLNIR.</speaker>
<l>Dismiss all fear.</l>
<l>Here thou art safe as in thy Father's palace.</l>
<l>My hardy Danes shall form a bulwark round thee,</l>
<l>As round the temple of some sacred power,</l>
<l>By whose superiour aid they may obtain</l>
<l>Each splendid trophy of triumphant war,</l>
<l>Wealth, conquest, and renown.—Lead to the tent</l>
<l>Of Rodolph's captive, this illustrious stranger.</l>
<l>Collect a band of the most beauteous slaves</l>
<l>To wait upon her person. She demands</l>
<l>Respect and reverence from each Son of Denmark.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Collect them not; I need not their attendance.</l>
<l>Send back with speedy diligence my guides.</l>
<l>'Tis meet I should be private. To thy worth</l>
<l>I trust, great Chief, for safety and protection.</l>

<l>They stole upon us in this silent hour,</l>

<l>For eighteen years</l>
<l>Hath Volnir held me an unwilling prisoner.—</l>
<l>But now thou shalt conduct me to thy Mother,</l>
<l>Much do I wish to see that best of Women.</l>
<l>There shalt thou question me, and I will answer</l>
<l>Throughout the live-long day. Nor wilt thou hear</l>
<l>An uninstructive lesson. My experience</l>
<l>Hath dearly been acquired, thro' many a scene</l>
<l>Of checquer'd life, by varying fortune cast.</l>
<l>But now each boistrous storm is over-blown,</l>
<l>And I shall spend my life's decline in peace,</l>
<l>Sequester'd from the world.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>That must not be.</l>
<l>I here resign to thee my borrow'd state.</l>
<l>Thy King, thy Country, claim thy sage advice.</l>
<l>Nor art thou yet by years so much enfeebled,</l>
<l>But they may claim thy valour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>Oh! my Son!</l>
<l>Thy duty charms me. I shall not be needed;</l>
<l>For thou art all their own.—The tears of joy</l>
<l>Moisten my cheeks my Children, while I think</l>
<l>Upon your virtues.—Happy, happy Sigebert!</l>
<l>In the warm hours of youth I could not see</l>
<l>Such true, such home-felt satisfaction.</l>
<l>O'erpast misfortune, e'en to luxury</l>
<l><pb n="83" facs="87"/>Heightens my joy. Now do I know indeed</l>
<l>What 'tis to be a Father—exquisite</l>
<l>Is the delight from Children such as mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDITHA.</speaker>
<l>Benignant Heaven!—Ye fierce, ye boasted Heroes!</l>
<l>Ye Conquerors of the world! here look with envy.</l>
<l>We taste, we feel what you in vain desire,</l>
<l>What war and ravaged countries cannot yield,</l>
<l>True, real happiness.</l>
<stage>(<hi>Trumpet.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>What sounds are these?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>'Tis Albert, from the slaughter of the Danes</l>
<l>Returning. <stage>(<hi>Enter</hi> Albert.)</stage> Oh! my Friend! let me embrace thee.</l>
<l>My Editha is safe—And I have found</l>
<l>A Father here. This is the noble Earl</l>
<l>Whom well thou know'st by fame: This is my Father.</l>
<l>Him too from hapless slavery have we rescued.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>The brave and virtuous empty forms despise:</l>
<l>They mingle in an instant souls together.</l>
<l>Brave Albert! Second Son! whose patriot virtues</l>
<stage>(<hi>Embracing</hi>)</stage>
<l>Fill my old heart with warm affection 'tward thee,</l>
<l>Thus let me strain thee to my breast!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="84" facs="88"/>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>How sweet</l>
<l>Are the applauses of the wise and good!</l>
<l>My heart acknowledges the warmth of thine,</l>
<l>And every string accordant vibrates here.—</l>
<l>O Editha! Thou little think'st what pleasure</l>
<l>I feel in thy deliverance: not more</l>
<l>Thy Brother, or thy Father feels.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDITHA.</speaker>
<l>The thanks</l>
<l>A grateful soul can give, receive. The worth</l>
<l>Of Albert I revere; thy Country saved</l>
<l>Shall join its praise with mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>How far my Friend</l>
<l>Was thy pursuit?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>To yonder heights they fled.</l>
<l>There were they rallied by their Chief again,</l>
<l>Who bravely fought. All that a Leader could,</l>
<l>To turn the desperate fortune of the day,</l>
<l>He did. At length, when all was lost, he join'd</l>
<l>His flying bands, who now in wild dismay</l>
<l>Haste to their ships; our victory's compleat.</l>
<l>But say my Friend, the treacherous Gunhilda,</l>
<l>Hast thou not found her in the Camp?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>She lies</l>
<l>Dead in this tent, slain by mistake for her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="85" facs="89"/>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>For Editha! Just Heaven!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>Now let us hence!</l>
<l>This accident shall be to thee explain'd.</l>
<l>To all my history shall be unfolded,</l>
<l>Each wonderful event.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<l>But first 'twere fit,</l>
<l>E'er we dismiss our troops, to seize and punish</l>
<l>The traitor Oswy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>Would'st thou punish him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRED.</speaker>
<l>Doth he not merit punishment?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGEBERT.</speaker>
<l>He doth.</l>
<l>And can he feel a greater, than to view</l>
<l>His murder'd Child? Could cunning cruelty</l>
<l>Devise one more severe?—Oh! Editha!</l>
<l>The tortures of the rack were light to this:</l>
<l>Well know I what a Father must endure.</l>
<l>To think too that she fell by his contrivance!</l>
<l>No, gallant Albert, seek no other vengeance.</l>
<l>Permit him to retreat, oppress'd with sorrow,</l>
<l><pb n="86" facs="90"/>And stung with conscious guilt. While we reflect</l>
<l>With pleasure on the difference of our souls,</l>
<l>Which bear no sordid stains. While we rejoice,</l>
<l>Raised from calamity and woe, to bliss.</l>
<l>While we congratulate our ransom'd Country,</l>
<l>And as we offer up our thanks to Heaven,</l>
<l>Pray, that she ever thus may stand secure</l>
<l>From foreign arms, and from domestic treason.</l>
<l>Free, glorious, happy, to remotest ages.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>NO longer now in pomp of grief array'd,</l>
<l>No longer Editha, the Captive Maid;</l>
<l>Prepared t' examine this same Tragic story,</l>
<l>In my own person I advance before ye.</l>
<l>My critic art at least this once to try,</l>
<l>And scan our Bard's defects with nicest eye.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet some apology th' attempt may need—</l>
<l>But by your looks embolden'd, I'll proceed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Who, without terror, Rodolph's fury traces?</l>
<l>Why, tho' a Dane, was he refused the Graces?</l>
<l>Were such the manners of those Northern Climes?</l>
<l>Why not have bent them to our gentler times?</l>
<l>To seek his Mistress' life!—So desperate grown!—</l>
<l>He should have rather fled, and saved his own.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Surely <hi>that</hi> Albert might have spoke more plain.</l>
<l>The City's Praefect—but my dying Swain.</l>
<l>Why had he not some crafty scheme devised?</l>
<l>And ventured 'mid the Danish camp disguised?</l>
<l>He should have crept, or swam, or fought, or strove,</l>
<l>And hazarded his trust—to gain his Love.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Th' affection of a Brother!—How misplaced!</l>
<l>And what a violence to modern Taste!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A soul defying death! and accents Roman!</l>
<l>How could <hi>they</hi> suit with any British Woman!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The simple, and the natural!—How stupid!</l>
<l>I should have ransack'd all the stores of Cupid.</l>
<l>Hopes, fears, doubts, jealousies, and warm desires,</l>
<l>Darts, arrows, daggers, poison'd bowls, and fires.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Are to a Tragic Piece my powers decreed?</l>
<l>Let it be great and Tragical indeed.</l>
<l>Let Passion cease the guiding rein t' obey,</l>
<l>Let Grief be strain'd to its sublimest key,</l>
<l>In frantic fury let me curse the light,</l>
<l>And die enchantingly, with all my might.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But egotisms and irony apart—</l>
<l>Say, have our Author's numbers touch'd the heart?</l>
<l>Have they from Pity stole th' ingenuous sigh?</l>
<l>And raised the trembling tear in Virtue's eye?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This is th' unerring comment; this the test—</l>
<l>And all remarks besides—like mine—a jest.</l>
